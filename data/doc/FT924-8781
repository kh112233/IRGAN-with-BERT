FT  10 NOV 92 / ISC man worked for CIA, court told
A FORMER executive of International Signal &amp; Control (ISC), the Pennsylvania
company acquired in 1987 by Ferranti of Britain, told a US court yesterday
he was innocent of arms smuggling, partly because he had been recruited by
and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Mr Thomas Jasin, former president of ISC Technologies, has been accused of
smuggling South African missile technology into and out of the US as part of
a helicopter-and-missile project destined for the People's Republic of
China.
Mr Jasin, who left ISC before it merged with Ferranti in 1987, has been
charged with violating US export laws.
Prosecutors allege that masterminded an elaborate plot to smuggle the South
African-made Striker missile, via an Italian company owned by ISC, into the
US for wind-tunnel testing, an essential step in mounting the anti-tank
weapon on US-made Sikorsky helicopters which were to be sold to China in
1986.
Last week the Financial Times obtained documents showing Ferranti was
involved in the Striker project, along with the Sikorsky division of United
Technologies and the US Army. Neither Ferranti nor Sikorsky has been accused
of wrongdoing.
Mr Jasin's attorney told a Philadelphia court his client was an innocent man
working for the CIA. Mr Jasin denied any wrongdoing, saying he was duped by
Mr James Guerin, the convicted former Ferranti deputy chairman and founder
of ISC, into believing the technology transfer was well within US law.
The government will try to refute Mr Jasin's claim of innocence in what it
described as a completely unlawful deal struck between Mr Guerin and members
of Armscorp, the South African government-owned arms company.
