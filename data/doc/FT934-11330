FT  01 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System
Currencies within the EMS grid stabilised as the D-Mark recovered following
the Bundesbank's recent interest rate cut and after strikes in Belgium and
France. The disparity between the Dutch guilder at the top of the grid and
the Danish krone at the bottom widened to just over 6 per cent as investors
adjusted their positions at the end of the month.
