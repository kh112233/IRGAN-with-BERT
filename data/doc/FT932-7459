FT  24 MAY 93 / Trade bans may save the whale, but not the elephant
BIO-DIVERSITY is the environmental lobby's latest buzz-word. Translated, it
means the more species, the merrier. But this diversity appears to be under
threat, at least according to statistics compiled by the World Conservation
Monitoring Centre, which purport to show that species extinctions have risen
rapidly over the past century. Humans cannot be blamed for the demise of all
species, the extinction of the dinosaur being one obvious example. Let us
accept, however, both that bio-diversity is worth preserving and that it is
human beings who are responsible for the rise in extinctions in recent
decades. What can be done to reverse the trend?
The standard response, enshrined in numerous international conventions, is
to ban economic exploitation of endangered species. Such a ban is the
mechanism that the International Whaling Commission has used for over 40
years in its efforts to reverse the collapse in the number of blue and
hump-back whales. A fortnight ago, at its 45th annual meeting, the IWC
decided not to lift its ban on commercial whaling.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) hopes
that by banning ivory trade it can reverse the demise of the African
elephant, whose numbers halved between 1979 and 1989, implying a loss of
over 700,000 elephants. The ban was imposed in 1989 and reconfirmed a year
ago, despite opposition from southern African governments.
Do such trade bans work? Not always, argues Mr Timothy Swanson in the latest
issue of Economic Policy. A ban on commercial fishing may be an effective
way of protecting threatened oceanic species from excess farming, he argues,
but halting trade in elephant products is not.
Whales are threatened with extinction for three reasons: they breed slowly;
they are cheap to catch relative to the market price for whale products; and
access is available to anyone with a boat and the necessary expertise. If
access to whale farming were controlled by quotas, their numbers could
theoretically be stabilised. In practice, a ban on commercial whaling is a
more effective way of reducing the economic return for fishermen and thus
discouraging their capture. But the success of this policy for preserving
the whales depends on the assumption that, left to their own devices, whales
would breed freely and flourish.
The same argument does not apply to elephants, which do not have the luxury
of living in huge oceans. The survival of land species, especially such
large and potentially destructive animals as elephants, depends on the
willingness of humans to preserve their habitat. This depends on their
economic return, compared to other land uses.
It is because investing in elephants has not been sufficiently profitable,
at least in the poorest African states, that elephants are threatened. While
the proximate cause for the decline in the number of African elephants in
recent years seems to be the availability of high-power weapons and the
relatively lucrative ivory trade, elephants were killed in large numbers
because government did not find it profitable to stop the poachers. In the
1980s, four countries alone - Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan - lost
750,000 elephants. All spent less than Dollars 20 a year per square
kilometre on park management. Zimbabwe, by contrast, spent Dollars 194 and
saw its elephant stock rise by over 20,000.
Little wonder that the higher spending governments of southern Africa are
arguing for the ban on the ivory trade to be lifted. Banning trade reduces
the incentive for African countries to keep poachers out of the parks or to
preserve elephant-friendly habitats. If African elephants are to be saved,
the economic return on elephant farming must be increased, rather than
lowered, perhaps by granting export quotas to countries willing to invest in
keeping the poachers out. Free trade in ivory may not be environmentally
friendly, but neither is a trade ban.

All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and
the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on
the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which
use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges).
German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the
former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period
averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by
Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.
