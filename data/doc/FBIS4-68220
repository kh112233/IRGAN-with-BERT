II.10.7.1.                       Technologies for applying (hard) coatings 
                                 from vaporous chemical compounds

                                 1. Application of a (hard) coating from 
                                 vaporous chemical compounds is the process 
                                 of applying a purely external coating or a 
                                 coating with modification of the surface 
                                 being coated, when a metal, alloy, 
                                 composite, dielectric or ceramic is applied 
                                 to a heated article. Gaseous products 
                                 (vapors, reactants) decompose or combine on 
                                 the article surface, as a result of which 
                                 the desired elements, alloys or compounds 
                                 form on it. The energy for such 
                                 decomposition or chemical reaction can be 
                                 provided by heating the article, by the glow 
                                 of a plasma discharge or by a laser beam. 

                                 2. Applying a (hard) coating by deposition 
                                 of chemical compounds from a vapor phase 
                                 includes the following process: powderless 
                                 application of a coating by a direct gas 
                                 flow; pulsating chemical deposition of 
                                 vapors; controlled thermal application of 
                                 coatings with nuclear crushing and also with 
                                 the use of a powerful plasma flow; or 
                                 realization of chemical deposition of vapors 
                                 with the involvement of plasma. 

                                 3. Powder application signifies immersing 
                                 the article in a powder made of several 
                                 components. 

                                 4. Gaseous products (vapors, reactants) used 
                                 in the powderless process are used with 
                                 several basic reactions and parameters such 
                                 as powder carburizing, except for the case 
                                 where a coating is applied to an article 
                                 without contact with the powder mixture.

                                 vapor. As a result of the process, 
                                 condensate or coating is deposited on

                                 the plasma or ion source is used for 
                                 ionizing the material of coatings to be 
                                 applied, and a negative charge of the

                                 inherent to the usual modifications of the 
                                 process of physical deposition of vapors by 
                                 thermal evaporation.

                                 uses a consumable cathode as the material

                                 arc discharge on the cathode surface after

                                 of the cathode surface leads to formation of 
                                 a highly ionized plasma. The anode either 
                                 may be conical around the periphery of the

                                 material, melts them and directs them to the 
                                 article, where an integrally bound coating 
                                 forms. Plasma jet spraying can be built on 
                                 spraying by low-pressure plasma or 
                                 high-speed plasma realized underwater.
