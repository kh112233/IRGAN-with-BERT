  [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- Some 68 percent of French 
people would favour French military intervention on behalf of 
Bosnia's Moslem-led government, but only in the framework of a 
joint U.S.-European operation, an opinion poll revealed Tuesday 
[24 May]. 
  Were France to take such an initiative on its own, 77 
percent 
of people would oppose it, according to a survey by the polling 
institute IFOP for publication in Wednesday's Globe-Hebdo 
magazine. 
  In all, 29 percent of 974 people questioned in the telephone 
poll said they opposed French intervention even as part of a 
joint operation. 
  If "the Europeans and Americans refused" to intervene in the 
conflict, 20 percent of those questioned said they would favour 
action by France alone. 
  A "solidarity train" was meanwhile to leave Paris for Zagreb 
stacked with packages for refugee camps in former Yugoslavia, in 
an initiative by the French humanitarian association 
Europa/l'Odyssee, reports said. 
  The Paris-Zagreb solidarity train, an idea backed by the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organisation, will leave Paris on June 18 and make stops in 
Geneva and Milan before arriving in Zagreb the following day. 
  During the journey, doctors, psychiatrists and humanitarian 
officials will debate the trauma of war and the "art of living 
in peace," organizers said.
