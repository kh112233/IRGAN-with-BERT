THE WEEK AHEAD: MANAUS, BRAZIL; 
THREAT TO THE AMAZON 
With much of the developed world now aware of the environmental threat to 
Brazil's Amazon region, an international conference will explore the dimensions 
of the threat beginning next Monday. 
Manaus, a city carved from the Amazon wilderness, will be the site of the 
weeklong conference on preserving Brazil's vast tropical forests. 
Participants in round tables and workshops will include experts on tropical 
ecosystems, agriculture, mining and economic development. 
The conference, known informally as "Forest 90," is organized by a coalition of 
Brazilian environmental groups. Some sample discussion topics: "Alternatives to 
deforestation," "Forest peoples," and "Mining, industrialization and 
environmental control."
