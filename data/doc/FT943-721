FT  28 SEP 94 / Jaguar unveils Pounds 200m XJ range: Ford expects cost of
returning ailing marque to profit to reach Pounds 1bn by 1996
Jaguar today unveils its new XJ range of luxury saloons, the first of a
series of three new cars planned for launch in the next four years, and
aimed at transforming the fortunes of the chronically loss-making UK luxury
carmaker.
Jaguar has suffered total pre-tax losses of Pounds 776m since it was taken
over for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989 by Ford, the world's second-biggest
vehicle producer. The US carmaker is doubling its stakes rather than
quitting, however, and expects to have invested another Pounds 1bn by the
end of 1996.
An important part of this spending has been devoted to the XJ series,
code-named X300 during its development, which has cost more than Pounds 200m
to bring to production. Mr Nick Scheele, Jaguar chairman and chief
executive, said the new car would help to bring the company back to profit
next year.
The XJ series is the first important product programme delivered by Jaguar
since the Ford acquisition. The cars go on sale in the UK this week, priced
between Pounds 28,950 and Pounds 59,950, and should be launched in the
company's 50 export markets before the end of the year.
The new model, which replaces the saloon range launched in 1986, must prove
to sceptical luxury car buyers that the Coventry-based carmaker has learned
the quality and efficiency lessons expensively and painfully imparted by
Ford since the takeover.
Jaguar's classic styling and design have often been the envy of its rivals,
but its quality and reliability have left much to be desired.
In spite of improvements in the last couple of years the XJ6 range still
failed to make it into the top 50 cars in this year's new-car initial
quality study by JD Power, the leading US automotive consumer research
group. The US is Jaguar's most important market, accounting last year for
46.4 per cent of total worldwide sales of 27,338.
The current XJ6 is conspicuously missing from a list of cars that includes
all its main rivals, the Lexus LS400, the BMW 5 and 7 series, the Infiniti
Q45 and the Mercedes-Benz E and S-Class, which all scored fewer than 100
problems per 100 cars. The XJ6 scored 128, significantly worse than the
industry average of 110. But it is closing the gap - its score was 233 in
1989, against an industry average of 148.
Mr Jim Padilla, the tough Detroit-born engineer appointed two years ago as
executive director of manufacturing and engineering - with the task of
ensuring that new product programmes are delivered to target - said that the
investment and restructuring of the last couple of years had yielded big
gains in quality and efficiency.
Jaguar had cut the number of problems per 100 cars, measured at the end of
the assembly line, from 1,432 at the end of 1990 to 281 by February this
year. A 15 per cent improvement had been achieved on its 1994 model year
cars, he said.
Labour hours per unit have been cut by 54 per cent between 1991 and 1994.
The hourly-paid workforce has been cut by 54 per cent, the salaried
workforce by 37 per cent and inventories by 35 per cent. The workforce fell
from 12,100 in 1990 to 6,750 last year.
Jaguar has invested about Pounds 110m at its three manufacturing plants in
Birmingham and Coventry to prepare for the launch of the XJ series. It has
installed a new final assembly line at the Browns Lane, Coventry plant,
ripping out equipment bought in 1953 from the Standard Motor Co.
According to Mr Scheele the new XJ series is 'the most significant new
Jaguar in a generation', but it is only the first step.
A substantial part of Jaguar spending in the next two years is being devoted
to developing a grand tourer sports coupe and roadster, code-named X100, to
replace the XJS range in the autumn of 1996.
It is also developing a range of V8 engines for use initially in the sports
car, and by the late 1990s as the main Jaguar engine family.
Most important for the future growth of Jaguar is the project to develop a
range of smaller sports saloons to compete with cars such as the BMW 5
series. Code-named X200, this car is due for launch in 1998. It would be an
addition to the range and would more than double Jaguar output to more than
100,000 a year by 1998/99.
The snag for Jaguar's UK workforce is that no decision has yet been made on
a production site. The X200 could become the first Jaguar to be built in
North America. It is being designed as a derivative of a Ford world-car
programme code-named DEW 98, being developed in the US.
Mr Padilla said: 'The important thing for car-buying motivation is the
product, not the manufacturing location. The feedback from our customer
studies is less than compelling in favour of the UK.'
