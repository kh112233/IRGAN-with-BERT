FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US to impose sanctions on China and Taiwan
over rhino horn trade
THE US is set to go ahead with sanctions against China and Taiwan for
illegally trading in rhino horns, irrespective of what the 120-nation UN
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decides,
David Gardner writes.
The Cites standing committee, meeting in Brussels, was expected to reach a
decision last night or today, after considering evidence that the two
countries had failed to stamp out the trade, banned since 1976.
But Mr Bruce Babbitt, US secretary of the interior, has said he will
recommend that President Bill Clinton go ahead anyway with a ban on nearly
all wildlife products moving from and into China and Taiwan, under a 1967 US
law.
EC officials yesterday said sanctions could be counter-productive at a time
when the Chinese and Taiwanese governments were trying to end the rhino horn
trade.
Investigations by environmental organisations have turned up evidence that
in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is still a brisk trade in rhino horns,
a traditional Chinese remedy for reducing fever.
According to the Environmental Investigation Agency, the price of Asian
rhino horn has reached recent peaks of Dollars 60,000 a kilo, spurring
poachers to prey on the sparse five surviving species. Zimbabwe last year
registered 1,500 rhinos, according to Mr Dave Currey of EIA, but this year
confirmed it had only 300.
According to the EIA, worldwide stocks of black rhino are down to 2,300;
white rhino to 5,200; Sumatran rhino to 500-900; Javan rhino to only 80; and
Indian rhino to 1,900.
