FT  27 AUG 92 / Rostock right-wing militants threaten to continue attacks on
asylum seekers
RIGHT-WING militants in Rostock yesterday threatened to continue their
attacks on asylum seekers and the police until the September 1 anniversary
of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland 53 years ago, writes Leslie Colitt in
Berlin.
Rostock police said they were taking the warning seriously. The neo-Nazis
had boasted that by then they would make Rostock Auslanderfrei, a reference
to Nazi Germany's policy of exterminating the Jews in occupied countries.
Rioters again fought with police last night and overturned a car. It was the
fifth consecutive night of violence.
Nerves in the city were at a raw edge after Tuesday's violence. Nearly 800
east German youths supported by neo-Nazis from west Germany threw Molotov
cocktails and paving stones at 1,600 policemen. Nearly 70 officers were
injured in the clashes, several with severe burns. Ten rioters were
arrested, one for the attempted murder of a policeman.
