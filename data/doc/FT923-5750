FT  28 AUG 92 / Paris gets the jitters as more say 'Non' to Maastricht:
Mitterrand is battling public hostility to the socialists in next month's
French referendum
TO persuade the French electorate to vote 'Yes' to the Maastricht treaty in
the September 20 referendum, President Francois Mitterrand's administration
is urging them to overcome their antipathy to the ruling Socialists - and
keep their eyes fixed on the hostile world outside France's borders.
But voters appear ill-disposed to respond positively to this appeal. One
opinion poll this week showing growing opposition to the treaty indicated
that 20 per cent of the French saw their vote as a reflection of their views
of Mr Mitterrand. A total of 45 per cent thought he should resign if the
result was 'No'.
The government has one standard response to these signs of popular
moroseness: if the 'No' vote wins, then things will get even worse.
'A 'No' would be unimaginable,' declares Mr Jack Lang, the minister assigned
to co-ordinate the government's campaign. 'It would destroy the collective
work of Charles de Gaulle, Georges Pompidou, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and
Francois Mitterrand.'
Rejection of the treaty, said Mr Lang, would unleash a 'catastrophic
scenario. . . It would mean Washington and Tokyo would rub their hands, the
yen and the dollar would triumph, and the D-Mark would become Europe's
definitive single currency.' For good measure, he added that a 'No' would
spark 'a bourse crisis, a crisis of confidence, a depression which would hit
the whole of Europe'.
Mr Lang's words of warning, though overblown, seem not entirely fanciful.
Concern about French rejection of the treaty has been an important factor
behind the unrest on European financial markets this week.
Mr Lang's sentiments seem also to have struck a chord with the right-wing
opposition. One of the main reasons behind Mr Mitterrand's June decision to
call the referendum was to expose splits on the right on its attitude to the
treaty. The president seems to be having some limited success.
Much to their discomfort, leaders of the establishment right, by asking the
electorate to put France's overall European interests ahead of their
distaste for Mr Mitterrand, are being forced to back the government's line.
Mr Jacques Chirac, the former prime minister and leader of the RPR
neo-Gaullist party, yesterday broke a political silence of nearly two months
to give reluctant support to the treaty. His intervention in the wake of the
anti-Maastricht findings of this week's opinion polls, could prove a
milestone.
'I shall vote 'yes'. . . I ask those who have trusted me to trust me again
on this,' Mr Chirac told an interviewer. Mr Chirac called the Maastricht
Treaty mediocre and poorly negotiated by President Mitterrand. But he added:
'My conviction is that we do not have the right to stop the construction of
Europe. . . to isolate France and make it in some way the black sheep of
Europe.'
It remains to be seen whether Mr Chirac's exhortation will be followed by
the Gaullist rank-and file. Opinion polls indicate that 73 per cent of
Gaullist supporters oppose Maastricht - above all because of fears that the
project for European union would dilute France's standing and power in
Europe.
Given the traditional support of French governments for the goal of European
union, Mr Chirac clearly believes that the opposite is true. His declaration
came hard on the heels of a statement by Mr Edouard Balladur, the former
finance minister and Mr Chirac's right-hand-man, pointing out that, for
France's international standing, 'the dangers of refusal (of the treaty)
appear greater than those stemming from its approval.'
As campaigning gets under way, the government will have to fight off not
only the diatribes of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the extreme right wing
and anti-Maastricht National Front, but also the arguments of other
anti-Maastricht campaigners such as Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the former
Socialist defence minister, and Mr Philippe Seguin, the nationalist RPR
politician.
Mr Mitterrand will also have an uphill struggle to convince the voters that
the treaty is not, as the pro-communist CGT trade union put it this week, 'a
mechanism of the banks and forces of finance' designed to 'crush' the
interests of ordinary employees.
The paradox is many voters fear that, under the Maastricht treaty, France
will automatically lose power in the new Europe - above all, to renascent
Germany.
Mr Mitterrand and Mr Chirac argue precisely the opposite: that the treaty,
particularly through economic and monetary union, is the only way to
constrain German power, above all by taking monetary policy out of the hands
of the Bundesbank, and investing it in the hands of a European central bank.
The politicians now have less than a month in which - as Mr Mitterrand put
it - to 'explain, explain, explain' what the treaty is all about. Even if
the explanations flow fast and furious, the fog of confusion, by September
20, may be only a little less dense.
