FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs push Coutts Consulting
into red
Restructuring costs pushed Coutts Consulting Group, the career consultancy,
outplacement and residential training company, Pounds 4.89m into the red at
the pre-tax level for the year ended December, against a profit of Pounds
1.22m last time.
At the operating level, however, the group was Pounds 701,000 in the black,
including an Pounds 823,000 loss on discontinued operations, mainly
accounted for by the bank training division, sold to Euromoney Publications
last June. This compares with Pounds 1.77m, including a loss on discontinued
operations of Pounds 616,000, in 1992.
Turnover from continuing operations climbed from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds
16.7m. Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 1.75m this time, compared
with a previous Pounds 4.77m.
The career management and outplacement operations increased profits from
Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 2.33m before exceptional operating costs. Turnover in
the division rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 14.1m.
Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, said that the problems which had been holding the
company back had been resolved.
Orders and management figures for the first two months of this year 'are
both encouraging and our cashflow is strong'.
The group said all the main objectives of the reorganisation had been
achieved - the termination of its costly long-term lease in London's
Docklands, which resulted in a total charge of Pounds 6.45m; the capital
reconstruction that had been hampered by Mr Barry Topple, the former chief
executive; and the disposal of the training division, which resulted in a
Pounds 1.29m gain.
Debt has been reduced from Pounds 6.28m in June to just over Pounds 6m at
the end of the year, and the group expects the strong cashflow to continue
the reduction.
The Pounds 1.3m proceeds from the sale of Winkfield Place, expected to be
completed at the end of this month, will also be used to reduce borrowings.
Losses per share were 20.56p, compared with earnings of 1.85p.
Sir Kit said the board was 'devoting its efforts' to the need to pay off
arrears on the preference dividend and to resume ordinary dividends.
The group said all outstanding issues with Mr Topple, who owns 70 per cent
of the preference shares, had been resolved.
He has been paid Pounds 180,000 for the termination of his contract and been
recompensed for some legal expenses.
