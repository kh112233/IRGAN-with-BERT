FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: New councils by 1995 - Wales
THE GOVERNMENT is pressing ahead with plans to reform the structure of local
government in Wales by holding shadow elections to new unitary authorities
as early as next year. It intends that these councils should take over in
April 1995.
The bill announced in the Queen's Speech is expected to follow closely
proposals in a Welsh Office white paper last March. This described plans to
replace the existing eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21
unitary authorities.
The white paper followed more than 18 months of consultation which found
support for the principle of unitary authorities, although the county
councils and Labour party argue there should be no re-organisation without
first creating an elected Welsh assembly. The government rejects this.
Mr Russell Goodway, chairman of the Assembly of Welsh Counties, said
yesterday that without such an assembly the current system should remain. 'A
very expensive reorganisation will not result in a better system and
improved services.'
The district councils, however, are broadly in favour. Mr Tom Williams,
chairman of the Council of Welsh Districts, said: 'A new structure of at
least 21 unitary authorities will lead to a renewal of local democracy at
considerably less cost than at present. Such a structure will save at least
Pounds 100m over the next 10 years.'
Mr Harry Jones, leader of the CWD's Labour group, said: 'We will be
monitoring the bill closely with a view to opposing, when necessary, those
proposals which might undermine the independence of local government.'
About 150,000 people work for Welsh councils and the biggest part of the
transitional costs will be redundancy payments. The white paper made no
estimate of the likely level of redundancies.
