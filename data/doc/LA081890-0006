CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN FRANCISCO; 
DRUG PANEL'S VIEWS DENIED PUBLICATION 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has refused to publish the recommendations of a 
state advisory commission which has recommended that California legalize 
marijuana and consider decriminalization of other drugs. The San Francisco 
Examiner disclosed that Van de Kamp's office refused to pay for the printing of 
the Research Advisory Panel's recommendations. 
The panel, appointed by state agencies and the governor, found that anti-drug 
laws have been "manifestly unsuccessful in that we are now using more and a 
greater variety of drugs, legal and illegal." Created by the Legislature in 
1969 to study drug abuse and possible remedies, the panel recommended that the 
Legislature legalize cultivation of marijuana for personal use, consider 
decriminalizing other drugs on an individual basis and legalize possession of 
hypodermic needles. Assistant Atty. Gen. John Sugiyama accused the panel of 
basing its recommendations on "personal views." Dr. Frederick H. Meyers, the 
panel's vice chairman, said he would use his money to print the banned 
recommendations, and called Van de Kamp's reaction "hysterical." Meyers, a 
professor of pharmacology at UC San Francisco, has served on the panel since 
its inception.
