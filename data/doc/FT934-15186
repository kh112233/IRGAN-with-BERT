FT  13 OCT 93 / Observer: Early bird awaits worm
If this year's Nobel prize winners were to seek any tips from their
immediate predecessors, the advice would surely be to press for the lolly
quick.
Last year's laureates were spectacular victims of Europe's autumn currency
crisis. Their awards, each worth SKr6.5m, were announced in October, but had
shrunk by about 15 per cent in dollar terms by the time they were paid in
December, following the November flotation of the Swedish krona.
The latest recipients have been told that their prizes, worth SKr6.7m, will
again be paid in December. Now worth a third less against the greenback than
before the flotation, the krona is still tending to slither southwards.
At least yesterday's winners, Robert Fogel of Chicago University and
Douglass North of Washington University, should understand, for they are
both economic historians.
They are also upholding a tradition, for American economists have now swept
the board for four years running, with the University of Chicago featuring
each time.
Self-effacing panel chairman Assar Lindbeck, the Stockholm University
economist who earlier this year led a benchmark study on the precarious
state of the Swedish economy, even went on to admit that the American
dominance of the subject extended into new economic history.
The last non-American to win was Norwegian econometrist Trygve Haavelmo,
whose reaction to the announcement in 1989 was to mutter his disapproval of
prizes before disconnecting his telephone and retreating to his country
cottage. Contrast Fogel, who was called by Stockholm at 5 am Chicago time
with the news of his honour. Already in his office, he whipped up the
telephone on the first ring.
