FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Taking the pain out of bacteria testing - Worth
Watching
Helicobacter pylori (HP) is an unpleasant bacterium that has recently been
implicated in the development and recurrence of ulcers, writes Paul
Abrahams.
However, testing for the bacterium has been expensive, requiring the removal
of a section of the stomach, a blood test or complicated breath test.
Cortecs International, a small company in Isleworth, Middlesex, has launched
a method of testing for HP using saliva.
The saliva is collected on a swab and mixed with a colour reagent. This
reacts with antibodies in the saliva, which have been produced by the immune
system against HP. The test can give a result within 90 minutes. A Pounds
275 kit can be used to test 96 patients. Cortecs: UK, 081 568 7071.
