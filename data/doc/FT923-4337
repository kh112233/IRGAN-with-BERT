FT  08 SEP 92 / Lithuanian N-plant scheduled to restart
LITHUANIA'S nuclear power plant, which runs the world's largest remaining
Chernobyl-type reactors, was scheduled to restart last night after an
emergency shutdown on Saturday morning.
The alarm comes a week before the 24 OECD countries meet in Brussels to
discuss who should foot the bill for repairing dangerous eastern European
nuclear reactors. A July meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised
countries failed to agree a plan.
The closure of the Ignalina plant near Vilnius followed the rupture of a
tube in the main circuit of the two 1500 MW reactors, which produce half of
Lithuania's electricity.
Mr Heikki Reponen, head of Finland's nuclear security authority, was given
assurances by Ignalina officials that no radioactivity had been released but
commented: 'The technical and control standards are extremely low.' The
International Atomic Energy Agency added: 'The reactor is not in the best of
shape.'
Last night Russian authorities were also denying access to the
Norwegian-Russian research ship Viktor Bujnitskij, which was monitoring
radioactivity in the Kara Sea north east of Norway. Norway estimates that 13
reactors from former-Soviet atomic submarines and nuclear-powered ice
breakers were dumped over a decade ago and it fears radioactivity could
leak.
