FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: US steel group plans expansion
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, is to greatly expand production
capacity at a plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which has shaken up the
industry by its use of a radical, new technology.
Nucor announced yesterday that it would expand the plant's annual capacity
from 1m tons a year to 1.8m tons.
The expansion would cost less than Dollars 40m, would increase the number of
employees by only 10 per cent, and would be in operation by the second
quarter of 1994.
The company pioneered the thin-slab casting method of making sheet steel at
the Crawfordsville plant, which began operations in 1989. This makes sheet
steel much more cheaply than conventional methods, since it cuts out several
stages of the manufacturing process.
Last year Nucor opened a second thin-slab plant in Hickman, Arkansas, with
an annual capacity of over 1m tons.
Until Crawfordsville began operations, the high-value sheet market had been
one of the few sectors of the US steel market in which the country's
traditional, integrated manufacturers had been free from competition from
low-cost mini-mills.
However, its lead is now being followed by other mini-mill groups and the
integrated manufacturers themselves. Earlier this month Armco became the
first integrated company to announce plans for a flat-rolled mini-mill,
which will be located at its facility in Mansfield, Ohio.
