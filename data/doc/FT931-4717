FT  10 MAR 93 / Yorkshire Electricity offers biggest price cuts this year
YORKSHIRE Electricity yesterday offered the biggest price cut of any
regional power company this year - its domestic bills are to fall by more
than 3.5 per cent from April.
The company said small industrial and commercial customers would see a
reduction in their bills of about 5 per cent. The announcement was welcomed
by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, who indicated
that other regional electricity companies should consider similar
reductions.
Yorkshire's decision follows announcements of price freezes at other
companies, including Seeboard and Eastern Electricity, and a 1 per cent
reduction at South Wales Electricity. Prof Littlechild said domestic
electricity prices should fall because of reductions in the price of UK
coal, a cut in the fossil fuel levy from 11 per cent of bills to 10 per
cent, and a reduction in transmission charges.
Yorkshire said it was the first cut in electricity bills for domestic
customers since 1986.
