FT  09 JUN 92 / Council anger at pay opt-out advice
GOVERNMENT advice to local councils to opt out of national pay bargaining
has evoked a strong response from the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The Environment Department, in guidance to the Local Government Commission,
which is advising on the future of the authorities, says the government
supports moves to 'greater realism, flexibility and performance-related pay
within the national pay negotiating framework'. It adds that it is also
encouraging authorities to opt out of that framework.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, the
Labour-controlled association says that of the 25 authorities that have
already opted out, most arrived last year at settlements that were higher
than the national deal.
