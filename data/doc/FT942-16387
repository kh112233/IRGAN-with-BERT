FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Detection of bombs
The world's first automatic bomb detection system for airline luggage is
being installed by BAA, which runs most UK airports.
The new equipment - devised on government orders after the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am aircraft over Scotland - uses computerised X-ray machinery to analyse
materials and match them to profiles of explosives, says BAA. A suspect bag
will be examined by sensors that detect explosives' vapours.
BAA says the equipment can check up to 20 bags a minute and will not prolong
existing check-in procedures. The system will be positioned in the
baggage-sorting area, to examine luggage after it has been checked in.
The system has been on trial at Glasgow airport and will initially be
installed at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports to check international
transit baggage.
It will be installed to screen all hold luggage at BAA's seven airports by
1996 at a cost of Pounds 150m (Dollars 220m).
