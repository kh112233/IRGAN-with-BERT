FT  27 OCT 92 / Hospital tries to change contracts
A HEALTH authority in north-west England has told ancillary workers it will
not contract out their jobs if they agree to new skills-based contracts
outside the national pay and conditions system, Lisa Wood writes.
West Cumbria Health Authority, which received permission this month to
become a National Health Service trust, has told representatives of
domestics working in wards that it will not introduce competitive tendering
if they agree to competence-based national vocational qualifications.
Mr Ken Hutchinson, West Cumbria's personnel director, said: 'It sounds like
a bribe but it's not.' The authority would make the same offer to catering
staff whose contracts came up for renewal early next year.
