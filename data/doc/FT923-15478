FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock plan for successor
MR Neil Kinnock warned Labour MPs yesterday that his successor as party
leader should not be forced to devote as much effort as he had to internal
reorganisation but must be allowed to 'accentuate the positive'.
He backed implicitly as swift a review as possible of the party machinery
after the general election defeat. His successor should be seen as winning
for the party, not within the party, he said.
At the same meeting, Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy leader, said the
party had spent so much time on internal reform and making clear what a
Labour government was not going to do that it had had neither the time or
the opportunity to set out what it stood for.
In spite of concern by some Labour MPs that the party's election inquest
would prove too superficial, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and favourite
to win this month's leadership election, wants any reform of Labour's links
with trade unions completed by the 1993 autumn conference.
Mr Smith is adamant that policy changes should not be rushed.
Mr Kinnock, in what may have been his last speech as leader to the
Parliamentary Labour party, said that 'years of denigration' of the party by
the Tory media had contributed to Labour's defeat.
Labour had to strive for trustworthiness so that if Conservatives repeated
'lies' about Labour's policies, they would not gain momentum. Labour had to
behave as a party that was serious about government.
The party also had to make clear that it backed 'efficient markets'.
The government's own figures show that since the election there has not been
the 'avalanche' of schools wishing to opt out of local authority control
that ministers had predicted, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, said that 56 schools had
decided to ballot parents on whether to become grant-maintained - a lower
rate than in the comparable period last year.
