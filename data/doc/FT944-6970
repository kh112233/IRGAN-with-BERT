FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Make way for Puffas
First it was the Barbour jacket that made its way from the shoulders of the
hunters and shooters of the world to the city movers and shakers.
Then it was the turn of quilted Husky jacket to make the transition from
stablewear to status symbol. The Italians, in particular, embraced it
wholeheartedly. They wear Huskies over their tailored jackets, keeping the
chill at bay in smart street cafes.
Now is the turn of the super-padded Puffa to leave the stable and rub
shoulders with its catwalk imitators.
Once best-known as part of the Michelin man, the padded jacket has been
taken up and reworked by top flight designers from Donna Karan to Issey
Miyake and is now found in every high street store. The trendiest (and
cheapest) are from Warehouse (Pounds 69.99) and Miss Selfridge (Pounds
34.95) while Next has a good one with detachable sleeves in its catalogue at
Pounds 69.99.
Those who prefer the original Puffa will find it in bright colours, as well
as the traditional dark blue, at around Pounds 90.
But the most exclusive and sought-after by far has to be the silvery,
waisted version by Gucci at Pounds 350. Definitely more at home on the back
of a Harley than a horse.
