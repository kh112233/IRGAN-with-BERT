NEWSWIRE: KIMBALL FACES SENTENCING TODAY 
Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball faces up to 22 years in prison when he is 
sentenced today in Tampa, Fla., for drunken driving-manslaughter in the Aug. 1 
death of two teen-agers. 
Kimball, 25, will be sentenced by Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe, 
before whom he pleaded guilty Jan. 11, the day after a jury was seated to hear 
his trial. 
State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 7 to 22 years on the 
charges. 
Kimball was free on bond before his trial but after pleading guilty was jailed 
without bond to await sentencing. He has been kept in a one-person call and 
checked every 15 minutes because his attorneys that they were concerned about 
his "self-destructive behavior." 
Investigators said Kimball, who won a silver medal in platform diving in the 
1984 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, was driving his sports car at 70 to 90 
m.p.h. when it slammed into a group of teen-agers. 
Kimball admitted he had been drinking earlier in the day and prosecutors said a 
blood-alcohol test administered that night recorded .20, twice the legal limit.
