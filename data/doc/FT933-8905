FT  13 AUG 93 / VW probe may recall witnesses
PUBLIC prosecutors investigating spying and theft allegations against
Volkswagen employees may recall witnesses for further questioning, following
reports that data belonging to Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General
Motors, may have been punched into VW computers.
The possibility arose yesterday after a televised claim that a female VW
employee had said she and nine colleagues had been instructed to store
material by an assistant to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's new
production director, and the man at the centre of the investigation.
The woman, allegedly already interrogated, had apparently said nothing about
the origins of the material when questioned. However, she reportedly told a
third party that the documents carried an Opel logo.
Mr Georg Nauth, a senior prosecutor and spokesman for the investigators,
said the reports would be checked.
It is understood several witnesses from VW, under questioning, have said
they could not remember - or could not rule out - whether material they
handled bore marks identifying their origins as either Opel or GM.
Mr Walter Hiller, a member of the VW supervisory board, said yesterday the
board had been 'credibly assured' at a meeting last Friday that an internal
investigation at VW found there was no such material in the group's data
banks.
The meeting unanimously backed Mr Lopez and said there was no evidence to
warrant accusations of industrial espionage.
Meanwhile, Opel threatened further legal action if VW did not tell it in
precise detail the nature and contents of material destroyed in the week of
March 22 on instructions of Mr Lopez. VW last weekend admitted that papers,
including possibly secret or sensitive material, were destroyed at its
company guesthouse to prevent its circulation within VW.
