FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
The upsurge in corporate activity prompted increased turnover in the options
market yesterday, although the futures continued the week's familiar pattern
of thin trading and direction-less drifting, writes Christopher Price.
The June futures contract opened brightly at 3,140, near its low of the day,
inspired in part by a good showing from gilts and bunds.
Consolidation followed, although there was a slight hiccup in the contract's
slow forward momentum in mid-morning with disappointing results from the
gilts auction. However, this proved only a temporary glitch and June
continued to edge forward with trading confined to a tight 20-point range
for most of the day.
With Wall Street closed, there was no directional help for June in the
afternoon session, and the contract drifted, finally closing at 3,153. With
seemingly little investor enthusiasm, volume was a thin 6,900. But dealers
reported an upturn in after hours trading, with June moving up to 3,164.
Lasmo again topped the stock options as the speculation over its future
attracted heavy buying. Turnover hit 7,581 contracts, equivalent to 7.5m
shares in the equity market. Overall turnover reached 37,037, with FTSE
volume at 7,517. Hanson was the second top stock option at 3,395.
