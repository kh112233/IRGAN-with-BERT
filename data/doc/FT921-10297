FT  07 FEB 92 / Eta blamed for Madrid blast
The Basque terrorist group Eta was blamed for a bomb that destroyed a
military van in Madrid yesterday killing the five occupants and injuring
seven bystanders, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The blast followed a string of police successes against Eta in the Basque
country including numerous arrests and the uncovering of a large extortion
ring funding the gunmen. It also followed a demonstration in Bilbao, the
main Basque city, last weekend that drew tens of thousands in the biggest
anti-Eta turnout to date.
