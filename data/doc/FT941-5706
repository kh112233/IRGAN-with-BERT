FT  04 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices strong - Market
Report
The London Metal Exchange COPPER market put in a strong performance
yesterday, capitalising on signs of downside support at Dollars 1,870 a
tonne for three months delivery. The price broke above Dollars 1,890 at one
stage before hitting late selling. It ended the after hours 'kerb' trading
session at Dollars 1,889, up Dollars 14 on the day.
ALUMINIUM largely followed copper, and after rallying strongly from lower
morning levels lost some ground late on to end below the highs at Dollars
1,283 a tonne, still up Dollars 8, in the three months delivery position.
The LEAD market crumbled under late liquidation after the three months
position broke the important Dollars 460-a-tonne level, confirming a 'head
and shoulders' chart formation. Stop-loss selling pushed the market lower
and final business was at Dollars 456 down Dollars 10.
ZINC was also hit by negative chart factors, as repeated attempts on Dollars
948 a tonne eventually proved successful, and prices broke lower under
pressure from stop-loss and investment fund selling.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures were given a late boost by
news Brazil had met export retention requirements at last.
The near May position closed at Dollars 1,232 a tonne, below a Dollars 1,238
high but Dollars 21 up on the day.
In the COCOA market meanwhile, traders were becoming increasingly nervous,
in the continued absence of supportive news, that the Pounds 900-a-tonne
support level for the May position might shortly be broken, with next
support seen at around Pounds 870. The price closed at Pounds 905, down
Pounds 6 on the day, after touching Pounds 901 at one point.
