FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The right mix for motivating
employees
Sir, Having pioneered some innovative motivational techniques on my own
business, and now simultaneously advising some of the UK's largest companies
on the subject, I must say I am appalled by the views of Alfie Kohn as
discussed by Lucy Kellaway in her article, 'Rewards for the top performers'
(Management, November 3).
The idea that 'incentives are equally hopeless at motivating senior and
junior employees' is an irresponsible, apart from wholly untrue hypothesis.
Certainly motivation does not guarantee success because there are many
factors to get right in a successful organisation, but all too often the
problem is that employees lack it.
Motivation is only in its crudest form about 'throwing money at people' as
Kohn implies. I see it as a package of features (of which money is just one)
as follows:
1. Making work fun. If we enjoy what we do, we do it better.
2. Recognition. Saying 'well done' and 'thank you' occasionally.
3. Rewarding specifically what you want your people to achieve.
4. Communicating informatively (rather than just instructively).
5. Showing your people loyalty/giving them job security.
Rewards when given should be 'little and often' so as to avoid resentment
and to create as many 'winners' as possible.
Of course rewards should be linked to what the company is trying to achieve
and there is no reason, therefore, that this should 'encourage sucking up to
the boss' or that it 'discourages innovation' if done properly.
Kohn's alternative, that we give employees a 'share in the decisions', as
opposed to presumably a 'share in its success', would strike a very hollow
note with my colleagues. Who are we kidding?
