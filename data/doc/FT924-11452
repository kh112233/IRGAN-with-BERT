FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Ode mode
Thanks to readers who sent in their verse, as challenged just three weeks
last Thurs, on the Air Ukraine flier-band learning English in Ireland. The
results could have hardly been worse.
While you might think Observer severe, your attempts often make one thing
clear - though you may be named Tim or Mick, if you think that's a Limerick,
there's something amiss with your ear.
Of a century of entries or so, the bulk had the wrong metric flow. What's
more, most of the rest failed the secondary test that the poem must mention
Heathrow.
But besides those who missed by a mile, a handful achieved the right style,
and the whisky will go to the effort below, which was penned by one David
Carlile:
Moaned a pilot from green Air Ukraine:
'Sure, I'm wanting to put down me plane.
This stack's made me head dizzy,
Kiev's never this busy.'
Said the Heathrow tower: 'Tough - round again]'
