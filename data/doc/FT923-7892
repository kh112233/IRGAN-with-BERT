FT  14 AUG 92 / Foreigners suffer sharp rise in attacks
THE German government yesterday said that the root cause of a sharp increase
in right-wing attacks against foreigners was the recent surge in the number
of asylum-seekers in Germany.
Presenting a catalogue of violence assembled by constitutional protection
agencies which include the secret service, Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior
minister, said neo-fascist and extreme right-wing attacks against foreigners
in Germany increased more than 500 per cent last year.
Although the escalation has since slowed, a government report released
yesterday indicates an increasing level of violence.
Seven people have been killed in the first seven months of this year,
compared with three during 1991. About 30 per cent of the 650 assaults so
far counted involved arson or explosives.
Bombs or fire were used in 383 of the 1,483 attacks recorded last year.
Referring to the rise of the right in France, Italy and elsewhere, he said
the problem was not uniquely German. Democracy was not in danger from the
estimated 39,800 extreme right-wingers in Germany at the end of last year,
he claimed.
The figure includes 4,200 loosely organised neo-Nazi skinheads ' 3,000 of
them in eastern Germany ' registered in Mr Seiter's annual report for the
first time as a separate grouping.
According to recent estimates there are around 6m foreigners living and
working in Germany. The main targets for attack, however, are
asylum-seekers.
More than 45,000 arrived in July, swelling the year's total to 233,000
compared with 256,000 for the whole of 1991.
Membership of the German People's Union, DVU, one of the extremist parties
which drew international attention recently when it won seats in the Bremen
and Schleswig-Holstein state elections, grew by 2,000 last year to 24,000,
the report said.
The far-right Republicans, which have also made big gains, are under active
observation by state authorities, the report said.
