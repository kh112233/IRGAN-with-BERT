FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (11): Best place to live in Europe - The
Good Life
MANY Norwegians might not believe it, but their country is rated the best in
Europe to live in, according to a new study published by the United Nations.
After surveying 160 different countries on the basis of variables such as
expected life span, economy, educational standards and use of resources, the
report suggests that Canada has the highest rating followed by Japan with
Norway in third place. For women in the world only Sweden is better for the
good life than Norway.
The average Norwegian household spent just under Dollars 29,000 in private
consumption in the 1988-90 period. Spending on rent, fuel and power
accounted for 23.4 per cent, for single people it was 30.8 per cent.
Families with small children spent 29.6 per cent of their income on rent,
fuel and power compared with 25.7 per cent in the 1986-88 period.
A total of 19.7 per cent of household spending went on transport and
communications, a fall from the 23 per cent in the earlier period, mainly
due to the big drop in the number of new cars being purchased.
Food constituted 14.9 per cent of total household spending from 1988-90 with
6.6 per cent of household expenditure devoted to clothing and footwear.
Beverages and tobacco accounted for 3.6 per cent of household spending, 8.0
per cent went on furniture and household equipment, 9.9 per cent on
recreation and education and other goods and services accounted for 8.2 per
cent.
Norwegians rank clergymen at the top of a ranking list of professional
groups when it comes to credibility and high ethical standards. A recent
poll suggested they scored 57 points followed by nurses with 51; doctors
with 46 and policemen with 37. Advertisers are regarded as the most
unreliable and dishonest group of all with only 1 point but car salesmen (2
points), journalists (3) and politicians (4) come just behind.
Five out of 10 Norwegians believe in God and life after death, but seven out
of 10 do not believe in the devil or in hell. Two out of 10 pray to God at
least once a day, while 38 per cent of Norwegians do not pray at all. An
estimated 15 per cent of the population have contact with the church and
Christian life, though seven out of 10 have great doubt and religious
uncertainty.
As many as 77 per cent of Norwegians thought it was possible to be a good
Christian without going to church or chapel.
The Cold War may be over but most Norwegians are in favour of a strong
defence for their country. As many as 86 per cent polled recently said they
were in favour of national defence compared with 81 per cent in 1991. Even
82 per cent of young people aged between 15 and 19 believe this, with strong
support on the far left of Norwegian politics as well.
Norwegians are drinking less alcohol than they used to. There was a 2.3 per
cent fall in consumption last year, part of a downward trend that began in
1988. The average consumption of spirits among all Norwegians over 15 years
old was 4.9 litres of pure alcohol per year. Norwegians spent Dollars 4bn on
alcoholic beverages last year.
Only 95,000 jobs have been created in Norway over the last 10 years and
75,000 of them are in managerial positions, according to the Central Bureau
of Statistics. In 1981 only 4 per cent of female workers had management
positions and 25 per cent of men were in managerial positions. Now 29 per
cent of men are in that position and 10 per cent of women.
