FT  19 APR 94 / PowerGen launches Rye House power station
PowerGen, the electricity generating company, will today launch the first
large power station to be built in the south-east of England for more than a
decade when it opens its Rye House plant near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire,
Michael Smith writes.
Like most other plants recently opened or under construction in the UK, Rye
House generates electricity from gas. The arrival of combined-cycle gas
stations is one of the main factors in the decline in demand for coal and
the subsequent pit closures.
PowerGen alone has a programme to build 3,000MW of combined-cycle gas
turbine plants. Rye House, built at a cost of Pounds 240m, provides about
700MW.
The company has already opened a plant in Killingholme, Humberside, and a
third station, at Deeside, north Wales, is due to open in 1996.
Both PowerGen and National Power, the other large generator, point to
reduced carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions as an incentive to build gas
stations.
Electricity privatisation critics say generators also want to obstruct
independent companies from generating power from gas.
Lord Wakeham, former energy secretary, will open the the Rye House station
today.
