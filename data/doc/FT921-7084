FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Health reforms answer to demographic change
Sir, In the battle of statistics on the National Health Service
('Temperature rises over NHS reforms', February 20), there is a vital one
missing. Within the next nine years there will be a 50 per cent increase in
those aged 85 and over, adding an extra 17 per cent to the health bill.
Bearing in mind that the NHS already spends 40 per cent of its resources on
the old age pensioners, that the medical technology costs are spiraling, and
that there will be a reduction in the tax-paying workforce from a drop in
the birth rate, it is only a matter of time before the Treasury gives up as
the sole provider.
It is therefore inevitable that whichever party wins the next election will
have no choice but to examine new ways of financing health care.
I have recently applied to become a fund-holder because I believe that the
real strength of the reforms is that they have introduced devolution in
medicine, by shifting powers from Whitehall to the districts - Home Rule for
GPs] At a local level the huge problems from the expected demographic
changes can be dealt with much more efficiently.
I was therefore disappointed to read in your leader today that Labour will
abolish the reforms, if elected, and return to a centralised bureaucracy.
