FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: Cuba barters its sugar
ITALGRANI, the Italian cereals and foods group based in Naples, has signed a
L100bn (Pounds 42m) agreement with Cuba to supply semi-finished food
products in return for sugar, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The deal is a further sign of the current revival in countertrade for
countries with problems obtaining hard currencies or in economic
difficulties.
The Cuban economy has faced a growing crisis following the gradual
withdrawal of aid and supplies from the former Soviet Union. It has also
suffered from the fall in price of some raw-material exports, notably sugar.
Italgrani will supply cereals, vegetable oils and pasta products, worth
about L100bn, in return for Cuban sugar of a similar value.
Italgrani's deal, double the size of a similar one between July and November
last year, will take effect in the second half of this year.
