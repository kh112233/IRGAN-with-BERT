FT  23 JUL 93 / Fears over China's drive to modernise armed forces
SINGAPORE yesterday voiced Asian concerns about China's drive to modernise
its armed forces and reassert its claims to the disputed Spratly islands, as
foreign ministers arrived in Singapore for a meeting likely to endorse the
creation of a new forum to discuss regional security.
Mr Wong Kan Seng, the Singapore foreign minister, had talks with Mr Qian
Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on the eve of a ministerial meeting of the
six-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) ahead of Asean's
annual talks with its trading partners next week.
According to a Singaporean statement, Mr Wong told Mr Qian that 'some
countries were concerned about China's military modernisation and its
possible impact on China's position on the Spratlys. Mr Wong hoped China
would reassure such countries of its peaceful intentions and said regional
security dialogues were one important means of building confidence.'
The Asean members - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand - have been alarmed by recent Chinese attempts to assert
control over all the islands in the South China Sea, including those claimed
by Asean states and by Vietnam.
Both China and the Asean countries are anxious to protect their fast-growing
economies from political instability, and both parties say they are willing
to engage in security talks.
Details have yet to be finalised, but some Asean officials say a forum will
be established to include Asean, its existing 'dialogue partners' (the US,
the EC, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea), as well as
China and Vietnam and possibly India and Russia.
Several Asian countries are increasing defence spending in the aftermath of
the cold war, partly because they are becoming richer and partly because
they want to protect themselves as the US reduces its military presence in
the region.
