STORM FLOODS HUNDREDS OF HOMES IN LOUISIANA 
The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison flooded hundreds of homes Wednesday in 
southern Louisiana and whipped up tornado-force winds that injured five people 
in Mississippi. 
Almost 10 inches of rain fell in the Baton Rouge area and 3 to 6 inches more 
were expected. 
Allison came ashore Monday in Texas and was blamed for four deaths in that 
state. More than a foot of rain fell in some spots, and authorities estimated 
that damage could total $1 billion in the Houston area alone. 
Louisiana and Mississippi continued to take a pounding from the storm as Texas 
began drying out.
