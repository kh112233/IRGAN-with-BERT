FT  22 DEC 92 / HDTV funds blocked again
BRITAIN has again blocked European Community funding for the development of
cinema-quality television, postponing an EC strategy on the new technology
until next year.
Foreign ministers, meeting for the last time under the UK's EC presidency,
were unable to resolve differences between Britain and its 11 EC partners,
which exploded into a row after the recent Edinburgh summit.
Yesterday, Britain refused to commit itself to a European Commission
compromise first discussed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president,
and Mr John Major, British prime minister, on their way to talks in the US
at the weekend. The issue will now be taken up during the Danish presidency
of the EC which begins in January.
The Commission has been pressing for a five-year 'action plan' to promote
wide-screen high-definition TV (HDTV) services in the EC. But the UK does
not believe proposed funding of Ecu500m (Pounds 404.5m) over five years is
justified; it says new technologies, such as digital television, are being
developed which could supersede HDTV standards promoted by the EC.
According to yesterday's Commission proposals, the EC would allocate Ecu80m
to the development of wide-screen HDTV services in 1993. The EC would also
consider a report on the prospects for digital HDTV and a possible review of
its strategy early next year. Britain supported elements of the compromise,
but refused to commit itself in principle to a five-year plan.
The events of the past fortnight have revealed the amount of political and
industrial capital invested in HDTV, with Mr Major accused of reneging on an
agreement made at Edinburgh to lift the British veto on HDTV.
Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, Dutch telecommunications minister, a critic of the UK
position, said yesterday she was disappointed by Britain's attitude. 'Maybe
next year the sky will be a little bluer.'
