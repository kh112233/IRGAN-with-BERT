FT  17 JUN 94 / Development of freight terminal should start by year end
Work on the development of the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal
should start by the end of the year, after yesterday's decision by the
environment department not to hold a public inquiry, Paul Cheeseright
writes.
Daventry District Council has already said it is prepared to grant planning
permission for a rail port with 2.3m sq ft of manufacturing and distribution
space. The site is south of the M6-M1 interchange and next to the west coast
line.
Abbcott Estates, the developer, in which Severn Trent Water has a majority
stake, said the finished scheme would have a value of Pounds 140m. It will
compete for Channel tunnel traffic with Hams Hall, east of Birmingham, which
is being developed by Trafalgar House and PowerGen.
