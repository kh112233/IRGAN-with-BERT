FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas posts record
third-term earnings
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace group, yesterday reported record
third-quarter earnings of Dollars 142m. It forecast it would top Wall
Street's expectations for the full year, in spite of the sharp downturn in
US defence spending and a recession in the civil aviation industry.
The results underscore a year-long financial recovery at McDonnell Douglas,
helped by a large cost-cutting programme. Its shares surged Dollars 4 3/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange, to end at Dollars 98 1/4 .
The earnings worked through at Dollars 3.62 a share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 42m, or Dollars 1.09, in the same period of last year, when
McDonnell Douglas took a Dollars 167m after-tax charge on the controversial
C-17 military transport aircraft, which it has been developing for the
Pentagon. Revenues dipped to Dollars 3.43bn from Dollars 3.89bn.
Its military aircraft operations made Dollars 142m, compared with a Dollars
166m loss. Commercial aircraft made Dollars 16m, down from Dollars 37m, and
missiles made an unchanged Dollars 65m, in spite of a Dollars 51m pre-tax
charge for electronic systems problems.
The figures were affected by various special items, resulting in a net
unusual gain of Dollars 41m. Stripping this out, the company made Dollars
101m, or Dollars 2.57 a share in the quarter, and Dollars 308m, or Dollars
7.85 in the first nine months of the year.
The period saw further improvement in the company's balance sheet, with debt
of its manufacturing side falling Dollars 369m to Dollars 1.97bn, 29 per
cent lower than at the start of 1993.
Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said that the company's self-imposed aims
of cutting debt to Dollars 1.8bn by year-end and generating Dollars 1bn in
1993 cash flow, now appeared conservative.
So too were Wall Street forecasts that the group would earn Dollars 10.78
from operations for the full year, or Dollars 2.93 a share in the final
quarter. The company expected to top the record Dollars 3 a share it earned
in the final quarter of 1988.
These figures exclude any charges the company might make as a result of
discussions with the Pentagon for settlement of their dispute over the C-17.
McDonnell announced last week that such a settlement could mean a Dollars
450m pre-tax charge against earnings but would not mean a significant cash
impact and would allow the C-17 programme to continue.
Congressional officials have suggested the initial programme size could be
cut to 40 aircraft from 120.
