FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Chancellor's measures laid
out in detail
This section explains the general approach used in the table to estimate the
effects on receipts of Budget measures. It also provides more detail on
specific measures. The accompanying table shows the effects of tax changes
announced before the Budget.
The table gives the direct effects on receipts of changes in taxation and
national insurance. Estimates are rounded to the nearest Pounds 5m.
'Negligible' means less than Pounds 3m. Measures are costed in the order in
which they appear in the table.
The direct effect of a tax change is the difference between the yield of tax
which would arise on the basis of the rates of tax, allowances, etc.
prevailing before the Budget (the pre-Budget regime) and the yield after the
changes proposed in the Budget (the post-Budget regime).
The difference in yield is generally calculated by applying the pre-and
post-Budget regimes to the same tax base. This base is the post-Budget base
 -that is, the levels of income, consumption, profits, etc. forecast for
future years on the assumption that all the measures proposed in the Budget
take effect.
Thus the direct effects are estimated subject to the constraint that, in
general, total incomes and total expenditure are fixed at their post-Budget
levels. In other words the estimates in the table do not include income
effects - that is, effects arising solely from the impact of changes in
taxes on disposable income.
Nor do they include the effects of changes in the tax base arising from
changes in pre-tax incomes, the general level of prices or other
macro-economic variables which may result from the proposed tax changes.
Other behavioural effects are taken into account where it is thought that
they will have a significant effect on the yield, for example tax changes
which alter the allocation of savings between different financial
instruments or affect the composition of expenditure. Some change between
the pre- and post-Budget tax bases is thus implicitly allowed for in these
cases, subject to the overall constraint on total incomes and expenditure
outlined above.
For Customs and Excise taxes and duties, all the estimates of yield
incorporate the effects of the tax changes on relative prices and associated
changes in the pattern of consumers' expenditure. Aggregate income and
consumers' expenditure at factor cost are assumed not to change. Behavioural
effects are taken into account for Inland Revenue taxes for changes
involving the take-up of a new or modified relief.
Most of the figures for direct effects shown in the table represent the
change in the yield of the tax in question. Where appropriate, however, the
effects on the yield of other taxes are also incorporated. For example, the
direct effect of a change in the excise duties on tobacco incorporates, in
addition to the change in the yield from tobacco duties, the change in the
yield of VAT and other excise duties resulting from changes in the
composition of consumers' expenditure.
As a general rule, only repercussions on the yield of other taxes of the
same type are allowed for, such as other taxes on expenditure in the case of
tobacco duties but not taxes on income or profits.
The post-Budget forecast of each tax given in the table takes account of all
the effects of the measures announced in the Budget, and not just the direct
effects included in the table.
The figures in the first column of the table show the direct effect of the
Budget proposals on receipts in 1992-93. Budget proposals are compared with
a non-indexed base - that is, with the pre-Budget regime of allowances,
thresholds and rates of duty at 1991-92 levels.
The figures in second column show the direct effect of the Budget proposals
on receipts in 1992-93 measured against an indexed base. The indexed base
for 1992-93 is obtained by increasing allowances, thresholds and rates of
duty in line with the increase in the RPI over the year to December 1991
(4.5 per cent).
The figures in the third column show the direct effect on receipts in
1993-94, also measured against an indexed base. For this comparison, both
the Budget proposals and the indexed base for 1992-93 have been further
indexed by the forecast movement in the RPI between the fourth quarters of
1991 and 1992.
The following notes refer by number to individual line entries in the table.
Income tax 6 The cost in 1993-94 includes the effects of statutory
indexation of the lower rate limit for 1993-94. There is also a public
expenditure cost of Pounds 30m in 1992-93 and Pounds 35m in 1993-94 in
respect of mortgage interest relief at 25 per cent for those liable to tax
only at the new lower rate. This will be charged to the Reserve.
8 From April 1993 married couples will, by agreement, be able to choose to
set all of the married couple's allowance against the wife's instead of the
husband's income, or to share it equally.
Alternatively, married women will be able to choose to set half of the
married couple's allowance against their own income instead of their
husband's. If none of these options is taken, the allowance will be given to
the husband, as now. The cost of Pounds 10m is based on the assumption that
couples will choose to set the allowance against the wife's income where she
is a higher rate taxpayer and he is not, thus reducing the couple's total
tax liability.
9-11 The effect of the changes in car and fuel benefit scales on employers'
national insurance contributions is shown in the table. The effect of the
similar change to VAT fuel scales is also shown in the table.
12 The rules for tax relief on maintenance payments will be changed to take
account of the establishment of the Child Support Agency in 1993.
13 The tax rules governing certificates of deposit will be amended to enable
paperless, or 'dematerialised', certificates of deposit to be treated in the
same way as paper certificates.
14 The current rules which require payers of dividends to forward vouchers
to the payee along with the payment itself will be updated to take account
of changes in the handling of dividend payments and in particular electronic
transfer.
15 The provisions governing the making of returns on interest paid to
non-residents will be brought into line with those on the deduction of tax
from this interest.
16 The abolition of the statutory remuneration to paying and collecting
agents will give a public expenditure saving of some Pounds 1.5m a year.
17 This shows the effect on income tax receipts. The effect on receipts of
national insurance contributions is shown in the table.
Income and corporation tax 18 The cost of relaxing the restrictions on
capital allowances for most business cars is expected to rise to a maximum
of Pounds 220m in later years.
19 Capital expenditure on computer software acquired under licence will
qualify for 25 per cent plant and machinery capital allowances from 10 March
1992, bringing it into line with computer software acquired outright.
21 With effect from 10 March 1992 where rent for a chargeable period is
payable in arrear between connected persons, and the rent is an allowable
expense of the payer, the recipient of the rent will be chargeable to tax on
the rent which accrued in that period. The yield arises from the change in
the basis of liability to tax on rent payable under existing arrangements; a
further yield of Pounds 100m is expected in 1994-95. Without this measure
there could be a significant loss of tax in the future.
22 Insolvent former deposit takers which have ceased trading and are in
compulsory liquidation will be allowed relief, against income arising from
their former trade, for losses carried forward and for certain expenses.
Relief will apply for chargeable periods ending after 10 March 1991.
24 The rules for tax relief for charitable covenants will be amended so that
a power to terminate a covenant will be ignored until it is exercised,
provided that it cannot be exercised within the minimum period.
25 The power to inspect charities' records of donations under the Gift Aid
scheme will be extended to cover other income on which charities claim tax
repayments.
26 The 1992 Friendly Societies Bill, when enacted, will enable registered
friendly societies to incorporate, form subsidiaries and generally extend
the scope of the financial services they can provide. The Budget measures
will eliminate the tax charges which would otherwise arise on incorporation,
and which would act as a disincentive to incorporation. They will also
extend to incorporated societies the limited tax exemptions which apply to
registered societies.
Income tax and capital gains tax 27 With effect from 6 April 1992 it will be
possible to subscribe up to Pounds 6,000 a year to a general PEP in
investment or unit trusts with at least half of their holdings in EC
equities. The cost of this measure is expected to rise in later years.
28 Some technical changes concerning property management subsidiaries will
also be made.
29 The relief on private rented housing was already due to expire at the end
of 1993. The saving in later years from also abolishing relief for trading
companies is Pounds 15m. In 1994-95 there will be some extra cost as a
result of acceleration of investment to 1993-94. The total saving from the
abolition of all reliefs under the Business Expansion Scheme will be Pounds
130m in later years.
30 The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made
with tax relief under the Finance Act 1989 will be increased. It will rise
to Pounds 75,000 in line with the statutory indexation provisions (based on
the increase of 4.5 per cent in the Retail Prices Index in the year to
December 1991).
Capital gains tax 31 The estimated full year cost of indexation of the
capital gains tax annual exempt amount in respect of 1992-93 liabilities is
Pounds 5m.
Inheritance tax 32 The estimated full year cost of the increase in the
inheritance tax threshold attributable to taxable estates in 1992-93 is
Pounds 25m, measured against an indexed base.
33 The new 100 per cent rate of business and agricultural relief will apply
to business assets and farmlands that currently qualify for 50 per cent
relief with two changes. It will be extended to holdings of more than 25 per
cent without control in Unlisted Securities Market (USM) companies. But
controlling holdings in fully quoted companies will continue to receive 50
per cent relief. 50 per cent relief will also apply to business assets and
farmland that currently qualify for 30 per cent relief and to holdings of 25
per cent or less without control in USM companies. These changes to business
and agricultural relief will take effect from 10 March 1992. The estimated
full year cost of these changes attributable to transfers in 1992-93 is
Pounds 55m.
Tax appeals 34 Procedural rules for hearing tax appeals, including powers
for the Special Commissioners to award costs where either party has acted
wholly unreasonably in pursuing an appeal, will be introduced. The new rules
will not come into effect before 1 April 1993.
Value added tax 35 The turnover threshold for VAT registration will be
raised from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 36,600 from 11 March 1992, and the
deregistration threshold from Pounds 33,600 to Pounds 35,100 from 1 May
1992.
36 There is a cost to this measure because the once-off cashflow gain from
the system of monthly payments on account will be less than that from the
system of monthly returns which had been announced. The main reason is that
the size of payments on account will be determined by past, not present, VAT
payments.
41 From 1 April 1992 VAT relief for charities and the disabled will be
extended to boats built or substantially adapted for use by handicapped
people; the provision of special toilet facilities for handicapped people in
charity-run buildings used for charitable purposes; repairs and maintenance
of equipment used for talking books for blind people; and replacement
engines, spare parts and accessories for lifeboats.
43 The wording of the VAT law regarding supplies made for a non-monetary
consideration will be revised to bring the provision into line with the
relevant European Community directive. No change in practice is involved.
44 Certain supplies made for no consideration (such as obsolete computer
equipment donated to educational establishments) will be valued for VAT
purposes at their current value rather than their original cost, after Royal
Assent to the Finance Bill.
Excise duties 46 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 1p on
a pint of beer.
47 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 5p on a 75cl bottle
of still wine, about 8p on a 75cl bottle of sparkling wine, about 8p on a
70cl bottle of sherry and about 10p on a 75cl bottle of port.
48 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 28p on a 70cl bottle
of spirits.
49 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 1p on a pint of
cider or perry.
50 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 1.2p on a litre of
unleaded petrol. The tax differential in favour of unleaded petrol will thus
rise from 4.0p to 5.1p a litre.
51 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 1.2p on a litre of derv.
52 The duty on gas oil and fuel oil will rise by 4.5 per cent, equivalent to
about 0.06p and 0.04p respectively a litre. (Gas oil and fuel oil supplied
to domestic users are zero-rated for VAT.)
53 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 2.3p on a litre of leaded
petrol.
54 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 13p on a packet of 20
cigarettes.
55 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 6p on a packet of
five small cigars and about 38p on a 50 gram packet of hand-rolling tobacco.
56 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 8p on a 50-gram
packet of pipe tobacco.
Vehicle excise duty 60 The duty on vehicles registered in the private and
light goods class, and the duty on taxis, will increase to Pounds 110, from
11 March 1992.
61 Three new VED classes for lorries will be introduced from 1 January 1993,
to deal with vehicles that will be able to operate in the UK from that date.
The rate for the heaviest lorry will be Pounds 5,000.
62 A new VED rate of Pounds 15 will be introduced for small motorised
tricycles with an engine capacity of under 150cc, from 11 March 1992.
63 All other VED rates will remain unchanged.
64 The arrangements for charging fees for special vehicle registration marks
will be reformed, to enable a charge to be made when a mark is not
transferred to a vehicle within 12 months of it having been reserved.
National insurance contributions 66 This shows the consequential effects on
national insurance receipts. The effects on income tax receipts are shown in
the table.
67 This shows the effect on national insurance receipts. The effect on
