FT  28 JAN 94 / Commission proposes to extend immigrants' rights
Immigrants legally resident in any country of the European Union should have
the right to travel and seek employment in all other member states, even if
they are not citizens of any EU member, according to a forthcoming document
from the European Commission.
The idea, contained in a policy document the Commission is expected to send
to the Council of Ministers of the 12 next month, is certain to meet fierce
resistance from an EU still unprepared to grant free movement to its own
citizens, although the latter is a legal requirement both of the single
European market and the Maastricht treaty.
The draft Commission position is contained in a 'communication' to the
Council of Ministers on immigration and asylum policy. This does not yet
have full Commission support, nor will it have the force of a legislative
proposal. But under Maastricht, the EU is called upon to play a bigger role
in immigration and visa policy, hitherto the subject of secretive, and
frequently inoperative, intergovernmental co-operation between the 12.
The recent scale of immigration into the EU - especially from the former
Yugoslavia and central Europe - has spurred EU governments to seek more
co-ordination on curbing this influx. The 12 are also groping towards a
common definition of political refugees as opposed to ordinary immigrants,
many of whom seek a new life in western Europe under asylum procedures which
vary throughout the EU.
The Commission paper also addresses the need to combat the recent upsurge in
racist attacks against immigrants, and policies to promote their integration
into host communities.
Intra-EU mobility for legal residents is part of this integration process,
according to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU commissioner responsible for social
policy and immigration issues.
'I know that's a big step, and it may be necessary to take smaller steps in
that direction, but that's what I'm aiming for,' Mr Flynn says.
