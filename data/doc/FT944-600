FT  24 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Gin for proper dry martini - Appetisers
Amid the ballyhoo over the progressive watering of Britain's leading gin
brands, James Burrough, based in London's Kennington, emerged with its
reputation enhanced. Its Beefeater brand remained at the former standard
strength of 40 per cent alcohol, while many of the others slithered down to
37.5 in imitation of Gordon's.
Burroughs has now added to its range by creating Crown Jewel, a gin with a
proper cocktail strength of 50 per cent by volume. It has the juniperry
character which is the hallmark of all gins, allied to those citrus peel
aromas which are part of a 'London dry' recipe.
There has been a suggestion that the distillers might have used grapefruit
rather than the more standard orange or lemon peel. This could be true, but
there is also an intense orangey note to the spirit of almost Cointreau-like
intensity. This is a pretty, superbly made gin, ideal for lovers of proper
dry martinis.
For the time being it is available from duty free shops only. Prices vary
between Pounds 10 and Pounds 11 for a litre bottle.

Good chocolates always make good last-minute gifts and, in spite of the
inroads made by Belgian chocolatiers in the UK, there have always been
English manufacturers at the top end of the market.
For quality and presentation it is hard to beat Charbonnel et Walker, One
The Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, W1X 4BY (tel: 071-491 0939) which
still keeps lists of customers' preferred centres.
Selfridges, in Oxford Street, London, W1A 1AB (071-629 1234) offers a wide
choice including its own selection of truffles, English and Belgian filled
chocolates. For post-prandial nibbling, try Cafe-Tasse Santos roasted coffee
beans coated in plain, milk or white chocolate (Pounds 3.25 for 150g) or
hand-finished squares of fine Belgian chocolate, brittle as tree bark, at
Pounds 3.85 per box. Duchalet, a Swiss dark chocolate liqueur on an apple
and pear schnapps base (Pounds 11.99), would make a worthy dessert.
French chocolatier Michel Cluizel has produced an almost pure chocolate - 99
per cent cocoa with hardly any sugar. If chocolate has gone designer, this
is the extreme end of the catwalk. Austerely wrapped in matte black and
gold, it is sold in 30g bars (Pounds 1.35).
The Chocolate Society's grand crus chocolates are easier on the palate. It
produces 'single blend' bars from the rare Criollo, Guanaja, and Trinitario
beans which make up only 10 per cent of the world's production. The flavours
are distinctive and the society also produces truffles using its own
chocolate and fresh cream.
At Godiva's elegant shop at 247 Regent Street, W1R 7AE (071-495 2845) weary
shoppers can revive themselves with a cup of hot chocolate served with piles
of whipped cream while choosing from a sumptuous range of filled and moulded
chocolates. The coin-stamped Ecu - milk or dark chocolate filled with a
bitter hazelnut paste - does more for currency union than any economist.
A wide range of quality chocolate is increasingly available outside London.
At Sweet Seductions, 78 Regent Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32
4NS (01926-431017), I found my chocolate choice of the season: a miniature
mince pie shaped out of white chocolate, enclosing a dark chocolate ganache
flavoured with rum and cinnamon - available singly (65p) or in packs of four
(Pounds 3.15p).
My other seasonal accolade goes to Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly W1A 1ER
(071-734 8040) for its aptly-named Elegant Thins: wafers of fine chocolate
in various flavours (Pounds 7.25 for a 250g selection).

Cyril Ray's unsponsored, elegantly written book on Bollinger champagne,
first published in 1971 and revised in 1982, was by no means limited to the
affairs and wines of that house. It is one of the best books on champagne
and its history, with special attention to the famous 1911 riots, when
troops were sent in to crush the rebellion of growers protesting at the use
by some firms of cheap still wines bought outside the region.
Bollinger was not affected. Now the book has been revived and updated by
Serena Sutcliffe (Bollinger, 221 pages and, at Pounds 20, less than the
price of a bottle of Special Cuvee). She has provided information on changes
in the last decade, details of the industry's structure and her personal
appreciations of Bollinger vintages from 1953 to 1988.
