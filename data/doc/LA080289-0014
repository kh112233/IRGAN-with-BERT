AIRLINE CRASH IN SIOUX CITY 
When I first heard, here in Los Angeles, the news of United Flight 232 crashing 
at the Sioux Gateway Airport, I was not sure whether it was scheduled to land 
there or only seeking a place to land. Then, my relief to learn that my 
hometown people were not killed was mingled with the sorrow for all those from 
Denver, Chicago, and beyond who were. 
The tragedy of it all -- the feeling that if the wing of the DC-10 had not 
dipped into the ground for another 15 seconds they may have made it. 
The heroism of the passenger who heard a child crying in the smoke of the 
overturned fuselage, followed the sound of the crying through the smoke, and 
brought the child out to its parents. 
Pride that two years ago the people back home had staged just such an emergency 
so they would know better what to do if the real one came. The lives that were 
saved because they had taken the time and effort to do this. The many acts of 
kindness towards the victims and their families -- the acts that made the 
papers and presumably the hundreds that did not. 
The fragility of life, the preciousness of moments of life that God gives us, 
the consolation that life continues after death, hopefully a life better than 
the victims ever experienced here on earth. The realization that for more than 
100 human beings Flight 232 was a flight beyond this earthly life. Hopefully 
for them the Sioux Gateway Airport was the gateway to a better life. May they 
rest in peace.
