FT  29 APR 94 / Heineken workers call off strike
Workers at Heineken's two main Dutch breweries are to end their eight-day
strike after a judge in The Hague said the blockades of the Zoeterwoude and
Den Bosch plants were illegal. The Netherland Union Federation members will
return to work under a pay deal which has been accepted by the two other
unions. The agreement gives workers a retroactive 0.5 per cent rise from
January 1, a further 1.5 per cent increase next year and a one-off bonus
payment of 1 per cent later in 1994.
The federation had earlier rejected the deal. Although its members were
returning to work, it indicated it would not sign the new collective labour
agreement and would not co-operate in reorganisation plans. The strike,
which was unusually bitter by the standards of the company and the country,
forced Heineken to import beer from its plants in France, Spain and Italy to
meet strong demand ahead of tomorrow's 'Queen's Day' national holiday.
