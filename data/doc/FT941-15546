FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Robots get their marching
orders
Robots are on the march. In the US, Frost &amp; Sullivan Market Intelligence
forecasts that the robot market will double from Dollars 592m (Pounds 400m)
in 1992 to Dollars 1.2bn by 1999. Pushing this expansion of nearly 11 per
cent compound growth a year will be competitive pressures for greater
productivity and quality at lower cost.
Robots will be used increasingly to replace workers in hazardous
environments, partly in reaction to soaring medical compensation costs, and
in complex automation systems. Until now, the US has lagged behind Europe
and Japan (the world's largest buyer of robots) in this market. Frost &amp;
Sullivan: US, 415 961 9000 UK, 71 730 3438.
