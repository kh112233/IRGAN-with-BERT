FT  16 MAR 94 / Tourism body calls for wind farm curb
Restrictions on wind farms are backed by the Wales Tourist Board today in a
strategy for tourism in the principality, Roland Adburgham writes.
Wind farms, which use turbines to harness the wind and provide an
alternative source of energy, face increasing opposition from Welsh local
authorities and residents concerned about visual intrusion and noise of the
turbines.
In its Tourism 2000 strategy document - to be launched today by Mr John
Redwood, Welsh secretary - the board says: 'The quality of Wales's natural
environment is one of the industry's greatest assets.
'Tourism 2000 recognises the need to conserve and enhance that environment
and is concerned about threats which might impact upon the industry, for
example wind farms.' It endorses the policies of the Countryside Council for
Wales, which opposes wind farms in national parks and other special areas.
Wales has eight wind farms and planning consent is being sought for many
more.
The board hopes its strategy will create 10,000 jobs and increase tourism
earnings by Pounds 700m by 2000. Tourism now contributes Pounds 1.3bn, or 6
per cent, of gross domestic product.
