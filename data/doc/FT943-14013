FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly net steady at Dollars
346m
Eli Lilly, the US drug company that earlier this week announced the Dollars
4bn acquisition of PCS, a drug distributor, yesterday reported almost
unchanged net profits of Dollars 346.6m for its second quarter.
It blamed the lack of growth on several factors including higher
manufacturing costs, increased spending on research and development, and a
special charge of Dollars 10m relating to the previous quarter's recall of
three liquid oral antibiotics.
The volume of products sold surged by 11 per cent, both in the US market and
internationally, mainly because of increased sales of products such as
Prozac, Axid and Humulin. Turnover, however, grew by 8 per cent to Dollars
1.68bn because volume growth was partly offset by lower prices in the
pharmaceutical division.
Worldwide, Eli Lilly said, competitive pressures were particularly evident
in anti-infectives sales. In the US, lower prices resulted from increased
Medicaid rebates and greater participation in managed-care programmes.
The Dollars 10m special charge was in addition to the Dollars 56m charge
already provided for the product recall in the first quarter.
Net income was barely changed from the comparable quarter's Dollars 346.8m.
Earnings per share were up slightly, to Dollars 1.20 from Dollars 1.18. For
the half-year, net income was down 5 per cent to Dollars 677.3m.
