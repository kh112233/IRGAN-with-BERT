FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26):  If you can't
beat the index, join it - Performance, Conventional fund managers' failure
to outperform explains the attraction of 'tracker funds' / Survey of Unit
Trusts
THE MOST important detail you need to know about a unit trust before you buy
it is, unfortunately, something that nobody can tell you - how it is going
to perform.
Unit trust performance statistics are complex, and can tell you which trusts
have performed best in the past. But nothing can tell you how well they will
do in the future.
Your best bet is to examine a trust's consistency. One that regularly
finishes in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) of a sector, without
necessarily setting the market alight, is probably a better bet than one
which occasionally tops the tables but at other times dips. This suggests
aggressive, possibly speculative, fund management. But nothing is certain.
It is even more difficult to work out what it is fair to expect from a
trust's performance. As a consumer, you will want to know how a trust can
measure up to rival fixed-interest products. Can a unit trust be relied upon
to beat a building society account, for example?
The performance of the last five years suggests that it cannot. But the last
five years appear to have been truly exceptional.
Another point is that unit trusts tie themselves to investment in certain
markets. If the market as a whole is down, a fund manager cannot be expected
to deliver a significant gain.
One lesson of this is that investors should always regard picking a unit
trust as a strategic decision as much as anything else. There is no point in
putting money into an excellently managed Japanese smaller companies trust
if the Tokyo market collapses.
Managers are limited to an extent by the performance of the market in which
they invest, and this is measured by indices. A trust which underperforms
the index has some explaining to do, even if its price has significantly
improved.
That, unfortunately, means that the whole industry has some explaining to
do. Over the five years to September 1 this year (an unflattering period to
choose), the FT-A All-Share, including all its yield, managed to increase by
19.65 per cent. In theory, this should do slightly worse than the average UK
unit trust, which is able to reinvest income in a growing fund. But in fact,
the average UK equity general unit trust, according to Micropal, fell by
4.47 per cent over this period. For UK equity growth, the figures are even
worse - a drop of 16.34 per cent over the same period. The UK equity income
sector has registered a drop of 6.87 per cent.
Over 10 years, the average general unit trust increased by 291.91 per cent,
which sounds quite good - until you discover that the total return on the
All-Share rose by 395.5 per cent over the same period. Income funds came
closest to matching the index, with an average growth of 331.22 per cent.
Only nine out of the 48 which have been going this long have actually beaten
the All-Share.
Under-performance is tolerable when the market is doing well - but over the
past few years it has put fund managers in a very unwelcome spotlight. In
essence, the average manager is bound to underperform. The index represents
the average performance of all investors, but it does not allow for costs.
In recent years, many managers have been hit because they held shares in
small companies, which have performed worse than the larger companies which
dominate the indices.
The failure of conventional fund managers to outperform explains the
attractions of 'tracker funds'. These make no attempt to beat the index, but
instead set out, using various complicated quantitative techniques, to match
the index exactly. Generally, this will mean holding on to a large batch of
shares and trading relatively infrequently.
However, as the composition of indices changes periodically, and unit
trusts' open-ended structure dictates that the number of units in
circulation must move from time to time, these funds cannot be totally
inactive, and so index targets will not be exactly matched.
But tracker funds do cut down substantially on the amount of fund managers'
time that needs to be spent in active management. As a result, reduced
charges are possible, although so far in the UK only Gartmore has taken an
initiative in this area, with no initial charge and an annual charge of only
0.5 per cent.
Other UK tracker funds have been launched by Swiss Life, Legal &amp; General,
Royal Life and Morgan Grenfell; and also by James Capel, which has launched
several tracking various world indices, and offers a portfolio management
service switching from index to index.
All have been launched within the past five years, so that fully
satisfactory judgments on their performances are not yet possible, but
things are looking good. After charges are taken into account, the tracking
error is small. Over three years, Gartmore's fund is down 0.96 per cent
(compared with a 3.97 per cent rise in the All-Share), but it is still 4th
out of 85 in its sector. Royal Life's is 20th and Morgan Grenfell's is 21st.
All three are therefore in the top quartile - a powerful argument in favour
of keeping them in a portfolio, at least as a ballast against potential
losses elsewhere.
Talented fund managers who go out of their way to pick individual stocks can
bring home big profits - for example, Capability Special Situations leads
the UK Growth sector over 10 years with growth of 635.22 per cent, and is
still second over one year. But many others fail to beat the index.
And if you think the market will recover, putting some money into a tracker
fund, eliminates the risk of choosing a manager who fails to capitalise on
the opportunity.
