FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Fokker prepared for legal
action on bond redemptions
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, is prepared to go to court to
prevent some of its bondholders redeeming their bonds early following last
week's agreement that Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) should take control of the
company.
Holders of two classes of domestic bond - Fl 150m (Dollars 89.7m) of 4 3/4
per cent convertible bonds maturing in five equal annual amounts from 1995,
and Fl 150m at 7 3/4 per cent maturing in 1994 - can invoke a clause that
allows for early redemption if the company changes hands.
Mr Henni Olde Loohuis, Fokker's corporate vice-president of finance, said
that bondholders could only try to redeem if they believed the takeover
meant there was a chance redemption could not take place at maturity.
'In the case of the convertible bonds, the clause is supposed to apply if
the conversion rate itself is hurt,' he said. 'Most probably we could go to
court and say that this does not apply.'
He said a further obstacle faced bondholders who wanted to dispose of the
bonds early. They would also have to hold a meeting and persuade the bond
trustee to invoke the clause.
If the bondholders succeeded, Fokker would not have problems refinancing the
bonds, said Mr Loohuis. The source of the new funds would not necessarily be
the bond market.
One Dutch banker was doubtful yesterday over the ease of refinancing for
Fokker. 'It would be rare to see an early redemption,' he said. 'But it is
very difficult for me to be positive about the question of refinancing.'
The issue of whether holders would call for an early repayment of the bonds
arose this week after the Dutch government agreed on Friday on the
preconditions for a proposed transaction that would give Dasa 51 per cent of
Fokker.
Fokker wants to join forces with Dasa partly because it lacks the capital to
develop new models of the Fokker 100, its popular short-range aircraft.
