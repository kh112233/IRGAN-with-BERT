P.M. BRIEFING; 
CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS INCREASE 
Federal investigators who uncovered 7,000 child labor violations during a 
three-day sweep last month found an additional 4,000 infractions in a review of 
case files, the Labor Department said today. 
Civil fines on the businesses involved are expected to total $2.9 million, up 
from the $1.8 million originally predicted following the March 12-15 sweep, 
said William Brooks, an assistant secretary of labor. 
Most of the violations involved teen-agers working more hours or later hours 
during the school week than is allowed under federal law, the department said. 
But there were also 1,450 youngsters age 14-17 who were illegally employed in 
dangerous jobs, such as using power-driven meat-slicing machinery, dough mixers 
and paper balers, the department said.
