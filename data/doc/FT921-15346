FT  10 JAN 92 / 'What are you waiting for, an invitation from the
president?'
PRESIDENT George Bush will address the British nation next Monday night -
not as a world statesman but as the star of an upmarket television
commercial designed to sell America to holidaymaking Brits, Gary Mead
writes.
The commercial shows Mr Bush against a montage of stunning US views. 'So
what are you waiting for, an invitation from the president?' he asks in the
rousing finale, adding: 'America. Yours to Discover,' which is the slogan
for a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m) promotional campaign that will run well into
April.
Mr Bush's drive is backed by a coalition of more than 35 US tourist
companies. Alongside the TV commercial - showing in London and the
south-east, Glasgow and Greater Manchester - advertisments will run in all
national newspapers.
Foreign tourists spent some Dollars 53bn in the US in 1990 and perhaps
Dollars 58bn last year, according to Mr Edward Brook, president of the
Travel Industry Association of America. British tourists account for about
10 per cent of that.
Ms Paula Saint-Armour, a senior vice-president with American Express, said
the new advertising campaign, to be extended across Europe, was kicking off
with Britain 'because of its size and because its potential for increased
visitation is staggering'. She added: 'The number of visitors from the UK
increased 160 per cent between 1985 and 1990, and is now at over 2.2m. From
a marketing perspective, we want to fish where the fish are.'
Mr Bush says in the commercial: 'There's never been a better time to visit
America.' What he doesn't say is that the US economy has rarely been in
greater need of the boost which more tourists would give.
