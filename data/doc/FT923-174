FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: A third of German youth hostile
towards foreigners
ALMOST one in three young German adults admits to being hostile towards
foreigners, according to a survey published yesterday.
The rest of the nation's youth views antagonism towards foreigners as a
serious problem for society - although second in overall importance to the
state of the environment - but only 25 per cent reject 'all forms of
discrimination' against non-Germans.
The study, which described its sample as 'self-confident, constructively
critical, realistic and informed', involved more than 2,000 people, aged
between 16 and 24, and was carried out by the Institute for Empirical
Psychology.
The ministry for youth and family responded to the findings with a claim
that other studies showed only 1 per cent of the age group surveyed was
prepared to use violence against foreigners.
However, the study, which appeared as sporadic attacks on asylum-seekers
continued, and followed the weekend fire-bombing of the Jewish barracks in
the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, showed that 13 per cent were
'resolutely' anti-foreigner.
In a previous similar survey, made in 1990, less than 30 per cent believed
xenophobia was a serious problem. Since the end of that year, however, the
number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany each year has almost doubled.
More than 400,000 are expected this year.
