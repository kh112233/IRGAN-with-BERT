FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Not a cause of sick buildings
Sir, Catherine Milton quotes from a conference paper by Alan Hedge and
colleagues suggesting that man-made mineral fibres are a cause of sick
building syndrome ('The answer might just be blowing in the wind', September
8). I have serious reservations about the paper's conclusions.
The most serious concerns the sampling methodology for determining man-made
mineral fibre exposure, and the statistical methodology. I question the use
of settled, rather than airborne, dust measurement. I also believe the
analytical technique for assessing the fibre concentrations was such that
the numbers of organic fibres were not measured. Yet the majority of
airborne fibres are usually organic, from paper, carpets, furnishings, etc.
The entire statistical conclusion of a significant effect of exposure to
man-made mineral fibres is based on just one exceptionally high measurement
of only one office site. An alternative, proper statistical analysis shows
no statistically significant association between sick building syndrome
findings and the amount of settled man-made mineral fibre dust. It can even
be inferred from this study that sick building syndrome findings may be
caused by the cleaning policy in a particular office park.
In brief, this paper provides no supportable information for or against the
suggestion that man-made mineral fibres released from ceiling tiles can
cause sick building syndrome. The conclusion that the fibres can cause the
syndrome conflicts with a larger recent Health and Safety Executive study
which did not implicate man-made mineral fibres.
