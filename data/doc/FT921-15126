FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Commercial Union bucks bonus trend
Commercial Union Life, the life assurance subsidiary of the composite
insurance group, yesterday bucked the trend by announcing it would not cut
bonuses on its endowment policies.
Pay-outs on 25-year endowments, which are particularly important as they are
often used as mortgage repayment vehicles, increased by 6.3 per cent.
The news followed cuts in equivalent policies of 5 per cent by Norwich
Union, the mutual insurer and 4.9 per cent by Guardian Royal Exchange.
However, CU is not alone in raising pay-outs, as General Accident Life
raised the pay-out on its 25-year policy by 3.4 per cent.
