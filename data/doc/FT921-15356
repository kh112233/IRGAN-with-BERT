FT  10 JAN 92 / EC threat of court action over projects
IT IS likely that Britain and other EC members will be taken before the
European Court for failure to carry out environmental impact assessments on
large construction projects, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner, warned last night.
'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European
Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said.
He added that the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of
such assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC
governments.
An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments
will be made in two weeks' time, he said. At present the directive applies
only to large individual projects.
'It is now clear that this is not enough. It is essential that policies,
plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact assessment.'
He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date.
Mr Ripa di Meana renewed his strong criticism of the British government for
pressing ahead with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because
environmental assessments had not been properly made.
The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media
'have left a bitter taste in my mouth,' he said. 'There has been absolutely
no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of
other member states.'
UK schemes that have been criticised include the Channel tunnel rail link,
the east London river crossing and the M3 extension. Britain and other EC
states have argued that projects in the pipeline when the directive came
into force in July 1988 should be exempted.
