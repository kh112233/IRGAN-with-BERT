FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wellington valued at Pounds 48.5m in stock
market flotation
Shares in Wellington Holdings, the seals and rubber products group which is
coming to the stock market, have been priced at almost 20 times pro forma
1993 earnings.
The rating is a premium to both Avon Rubber, the nearest comparable company,
and to the engineering sector.
Mr John Herring, of sponsors Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the pricing
reflected strong demand from institutions. 'It seemed to catch their
imaginations, partly because it is an easy to understand manufacturing
business which is quite rare among new issues these days.'
Mr Peter Chaffin, chief executive, said: 'We are really chuffed both at the
price and at the reception.'
Just over half of Wellington's shares are being placed with institutions at
205p, valuing its enlarged equity at Pounds 48.5m.
The company is raising Pounds 13.5m net of expenses while First Britannia,
the venture capital fund which owned 90 per cent of the existing shares, is
selling shares worth Pounds 10m. Its stake will fall to 40 per cent.
Directors and senior managers, who have just bought shares from First
Britannia for a nominal sum prior to the float, are selling shares worth
almost Pounds 800,000. They will be left with 8.6 per cent.
Wellington's operating profit increased by almost 26 per cent to Pounds 4.2m
last year generating earnings per share of 8.26p. That rises to 10.35p on a
pro forma basis. The notional dividend for 1993 was 5.17p for a yield at the
placing price of 3.15 per cent.
Commenting on the outlook for the current year, the company said that 1993
had ended 'encouragingly' with the order book 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier. 'The directors are confident that the prospects for 1994 are good
with organic growth anticipated across each of the group's three divisions.'
Dealings in the shares will start on March 21.
