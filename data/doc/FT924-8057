FT  13 NOV 92 / German tourists attacked in Egypt
Five German tourists and two Egyptians were wounded yesterday when gunmen
described by police as Moslem militants opened fire on their bus in Qena in
the southern Nile valley, Reuter reports from Cairo.
It was the fourth serious attack on tourists since Moslem militants fighting
an underground war with the government warned in September that tourists
would not be safe in Qena province, site of some of Egypt's most famous
Pharaonic temples and tombs.
The government has reacted vigorously to the spate of attacks on tourists,
promising to fly helicopter patrols over tourist areas and vowing tougher
police measures against the militants. This week it announced all mosques
would be put under state control.
