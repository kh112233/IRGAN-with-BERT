FT  11 APR 94 / World Bank to focus on the human cost of aid
The World Bank plans to strengthen its efforts to help people who are forced
out of their homes or farms by the development projects it finances, after a
year-long review of the forced resettlements resulting from its loans.
Mr Ismail Serageldin, the World Bank's vice-president for environmentally
sustainable development, said the Washington-based development institution
had already improved its procedures but would now make sure it agreed with
borrowing countries on a complete resettlement programme before a project
began.
Over the last seven years the bank has been involved in projects forcibly
displacing about 2.5m people - mostly dams - and non-bank projects have
probably displaced more than 30 times as many.
The resettlement review was partly triggered by the bank's involvement in
the Narmada dam project in India, from which it withdrew last year after
months of controversy over its resettlement programmes.
Publication of the resettlement report comes just days before the World Bank
board is due to vote on a loan for the Xiaolangdi project in China, another
controversial dam to be built on the Huang He, which will displace 181,000
people.
Mr Serageldin said that China, the World Bank's largest borrower, was now a
model for resettlement, because the government had adopted its own policies
that concentrate on resettling people in new jobs or land, rather than
simply compensating them for the property they had lost. 'The key lesson is
that it works best when governments themselves buy into the idea of
people-based resettlement, not property-based resettlement,' he said.
Outside environmental and development groups, however, are more critical of
the extent of compulsion in China's resettlement programmes, and the bank's
own report does not back up the idea that it has succeeded in meeting its
resettlement goal of restoring or improving the incomes of the displaced
populations.
