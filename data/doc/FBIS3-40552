  [Text] Thanks to the progress made in international space 
development efforts in recent years, topics related to space 
technology are becoming increasingly familiar to the people. For 
example, the images of cloud patterns over and around Japan, 
which are sent by the meteorological satellite "Himawari," are 
shown on television every day. The number of households 
subscribing to satellite broadcasting service exceeds 4 million. 
In addition, we are communicating with people in foreign 
countries using the international telephone service offered via 
communications satellites. In recent years, the use of the 
global positioning system (GPS) satellite launched by the United 
States is expanding from use on ships to use in cars, as well as 
to portable use by individuals. 
  The space industry has been promoting the use of the space 
technology that makes it possible to offer these services. The 
industry comprises the space hardware production industry which 
manufactures satellites and rockets, etc.; the space utilization 
industry which offers broadcasting, communications, 
meteorological and earth observation services; and the 
space-related service industry which offers various services, 
including database services using satellites. As their markets 
continue to expand, these industries are beginning to experience 
increased competition on the international market. Under these 
circumstances, the Japanese space industry is experiencing a 
turning point that is expected to continue up to around the year 
2000. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
been promoting a number of programs aimed at encouraging the use 
of space technology and services in Japan. These programs have 
been promoted through increased cooperation with the 
organizations devoted to promoting the use of space technology 
and other space-related establishments in foreign countries. In 
promoting these programs, the ministry took into consideration 
the recent progress being made in global information exchange 
services and the urgency of tackling the problem of the earth's 
deteriorating environment. 
  Figure 1 [not reproduced] outlines the current system in 
Japan aimed at promoting space development and the use of space 
technology. Table 1 explains the contents of MITI's budgets for 
space development in FY91 and 92. This paper will outline MITI's 
policy for promoting domestic space industry.

<H3>  Promotion of Utilization of Satellite-Based Remote Sensing 
Technology </H3>
  Remote sensing technology, which involves earth observation 
from satellites, is one space technology in which the demand for 
the technology is expected to increase for applications not only 
involving meteorological observation, but also for natural 
resource exploration, environmental observation and geographical 
survey. Japan has launched a series of meteorological satellites 
(GMS: Himawari) and a series of marine observation satellites 
(MOS-1a and MOS-1b) to conduct space research and development 
and to promote the use of space satellites. In February 1992, 
Japan launched a natural resource exploration satellite (JERS-1) 
that went into commercial operation that September. Japan has 
exchanged memorandums for the joint operation of the satellite 
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of 
the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA). In 
November 1992, data received from the satellite was initially 
supplied to researchers for AO verification. Talks are currently 
under way between MITI and the National Space Development Agency 
of Japan (NASDA) to make the data available to other customers. 
In the meantime, there are plans to launch advanced earth 
observation satellites (ADEOS-I and ADEOS-II) and a tropical 
rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite. There is also a 
plan to participate in an international satellite launching 
program in which Japan will provide the sensing equipment for 
earth observation to be launched aboard a foreign-made 
satellite. To strengthen the efforts toward natural resource 
exploration and the observation of the natural environment to 
grasp the effects industrial activities have on the environment, 
MITI has been promoting the development of an optical sensor 
(OPS) and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to be launched by the 
JERS-1 satellite, the development of a 
greenhouse-effect-causing-gas sensor (IMG) to be launched by the 
ADEOS satellite, and the development of an advanced visible 
light/infrared radiation sensor (ASTER) to be launched by NASA's 
earth observation satellite (EOS-AM1). In addition, the ministry 
is promoting the development of a next-generation synthetic 
aperture radar (next-generation SAR) and a next-generation 
greenhouse effect-causing gas sensor (next-generation IMG). At 
the same time, the ministry is promoting the development of the 
technology for the processing, analysis and utilization of the 
data obtained from these satellites and sensors, and is 
improving the system for distributing this data. Efforts are 
also being made to construct a database of satellite observation 
data and to construct a database network. 
  1. Development of Earth Resource Exploration Satellite 
No 1 (JERS-1) JERS-1 is a satellite that was launched in 
February 1992 for natural resource exploration using remote 
sensing technology. The satellite was developed through joint 
cooperation between MITI and NASDA. MITI has overseen the 
development of the observation system, including the optical 
observation sensor and synthetic aperture radar. The actual 
development work has been commissioned to the Organization for 
the Development of Natural Resource Exploration Systems (JAROS). 
The development effort is now passing from the test operation 
stage to commercial operation. 
  The JERS-1 satellite, equipped with synthetic aperture 
radar, 
is capable of performing multi-dimensional observation and of 
conducting observation in short-wavelength infrared frequency 
bands. The satellite is superior to those launched by the United 
States and European countries, including LANDSAT and SPOT. 
JERS-1 has drawn high expectations from researchers around the 
world for its capabilities in natural resource exploration and 
earth environment monitoring. Efforts are currently being made 
by the Earth Resource Survey and Data Analysis Center (ERSDAC), 
an extragovernmental organization affiliated with MITI, and 
NASDA to improve the system to process, analyze and distribute 
the data obtained from the satellite. 
  The data from the satellite is being received through the 
cooperation of ground stations in the United States, Canada, 
Australia and Europe. By receiving data from a European earth 
resource survey satellite (EERS-1) for the ESA, Japan has 
entered into a mutual cooperation agreement regarding satellite 
data reception with those European countries. The European 
satellite was launched in July 1991. A memorandum was exchanged 
between ERSDAC and King Abdul Aziz City of Science and 
Technology (KACST) of Saudi Arabia for the joint reception of 
JERS-1 data and joint research between them. Research is 
currently under way. 
  With the operation of the JERS-1 satellite, this joint 
research is expected to produce useful results. 
  2. Development of Advanced Visible Light/Infrared 
Radiation Sensor (ASTER) 
  ASTER is an optical observation sensor that is being 
developed for a future launch aboard the JERS-1 satellite. A 
similar sensor is scheduled to be launched in 1998 aboard the 
U.S. satellite EOS-AM1 for earth observation. This satellite is 
being developed by NASA. ASTER is currently under development by 
JAROS, with the development commissioned to the establishment by 
MITI. This sensor is an advanced version of the observation 
sensor currently being used on the JERS-1 satellite. ASTER will 
make it possible to conduct observation in multi-band 
frequencies in the thermo-infrared frequency range for the first 
time ever. This sensor is expected to be used in diverse 
application fields, including natural resource exploration and 
earth environment observation. In the United States, too, the 
need to develop a sensor similar to ASTER has been voiced. The 
fact that ASTER has been picked by NASA for launching aboard the 
American satellite means that the Japanese sensor technology has 
reached international standards. Considering that the sensor 
will play an important role in the earth observation system 
(EOS) project being promoted by NASA with cooperation from 
Japan, Canada and European countries, the sensor has been 
drawing great international attention. This has prompted the 
formation of research teams not only in Japan, but also in the 
United States with assistance from NASA, for developing 
application fields for ASTER. MITI intends to promote the 
development of the application fields through cooperation with 
foreign researchers, including those from the United States and 
Europe. 
  3. Survey of Earth's Environment Using 
Satellite-Mounted Sensor (Wide-Area Environment Monitoring and 
Surveying) 
  In recent years, the deterioration of the earth's 
environment 
has grown into a major international issue. The prime target of 
the efforts to combat environmental pollution has been to 
restrain the levels of substances in the environment which are 
responsible for causing the so-called greenhouse effect. These 
substances include CO[.sup]2[/] and methane. It is not yet 
known in which part of the earth's environment these substances 
are concentrated and in what density. The effort to monitor and 
survey the earth's environment over a wide area will involve 
earth observation using a satellite-mounted sensor (IMG) that is 
capable of detecting these greenhouse effect-causing substances. 
The earth observation satellite ADEOS is scheduled to be 
launched by NASDA in 1995. The development of the sensor is 
being conducted by JAROS, the construction of the ground system 
for receiving IMG data is being conducted by ERSDAC, and the 
development of data analysis technology has been undertaken by 
the Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry. 
All of these projects have been commissioned to these 
establishments by MITI. The sensor is designed to measure the 
distribution of these substances in vertical and horizontal 
directions in the environment by detecting special types of 
light in infrared wavelength ranges which are emitted by these 
substances. This is the first time that an attempt to observe 
the earth's environment using this method has been made, and 
thus great attention is being paid by environmental specialists 
around the world. 
  4. Development of Utilization Technology in Field of 
Natural Resource Exploration 
  In the search for natural resources, including oil deposits, 
it is important to comprehend the geological structure of a 
particular region on the earth. The effort toward grasping the 
structure combines the surveying of the earth's surface features 
and boring. Until recent years, surveying was conducted by 
dispatching specialists to a designated region and having them 
conduct their tasks using exploration instruments. Recently, 
aerial exploration using aircraft has begun to be conducted to 
improve efficiency, enabling a larger area to be explored at one 
time. Exploration from a satellite in space makes it possible to 
cover an even greater area by scanning the earth's surface at 
regular intervals. This new method has raised expectations among 
those involved in such exploration. 
  MITI has been making an effort to make it possible to use 
the 
observation data obtained from LANDSAT and SPOT in the 
exploration of natural resources, including exploration for oil 
deposits. The development of the technology needed to promote 
this effort has been conducted by ERSDAC as part of a 
development task commissioned by MITI. So far, efforts have been 
made to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing 
technology in exploring natural resource deposits by comparing 
the data obtained by these remote sensing satellites with the 
data obtained through ground exploration. In addition, the 
development of the technology to improve the data processing and 
analyzing techniques has been promoted to ensure the effective 
use of the data. The use of the remote-sensed data has already 
been started in the exploration of oil deposits and metal 
resources, as well as in the exploration of geothermal energy. 
The application field is expected to expand in the future with 
further progress in the R&amp;D of remote sensing technology. 
  In June 1992, JERS-1 began to be used for practical 
applications, and efforts are currently being made to adapt a 
data processing method for the satellite. At the same time, the 
development of the technology needed to process and analyze the 
data obtained from ASTER is under way in cooperation with the 
EOSDIS data processing and distribution system of the United 
States. ASTER will be put into commercial operation in 1998. 
  So far, Japan has lagged behind other 
technologically-advanced countries in developing the technology 
to use remote-sensed data. However, it is expected that the 
number of customers using the data will increase in the future 
as a result of the improvement of data utilization systems. 
Efforts to improve the system are currently under way in 
preparation for the reception of data from JERS-1 and ASTER. 
  5. Development of Data Utilization Technology in Field 
of Hydropower Development 
  In formulating a hydropower development plan, it is 
essential 
to grasp the available flow rate of water in a river. So far, 
data on flow rates has been obtained by measuring the flow rates 
at the measurement stations located along major rivers. Flow 
rate calculations have been conducted by taking the river 
surface area and other necessary elements into account. However, 
there are many rivers in which it has been difficult to grasp 
the flow rate due to a lack of measurement stations, as well as 
for other reasons. Under these circumstances, in 1991 MITI 
started to develop a method for calculating the flow rate in 
Japan's rivers using the data obtained from remote sensing 
satellites. 
<H3>  Promotion of Use of Microgravitational 
Experiment Environment </H3>
  A microgravitational environment prevents the convection 
resulting from the presence of temperature differences from 
occurring. Such an environment also prevents the separation of 
materials due to differences in the specific gravities of these 
materials. These advantages of a microgravitational environment 
are expected to offer a better environment for experimentation 
that will contribute to understanding physical phenomena better 
and to the development of new useful materials. To ensure the 
continued progress of space development, it is important to 
understand the effects on the human body of living in a 
microgravity environment for long periods of time. For the 
purpose of better understanding these effects, experiments 
within a microgravity environment must be stepped up in the 
future. Microgravity conditions lasting for a very short time, 
i.e., ranging from a few seconds to several minutes, can be 
created during free falls from high towers, during ballistic 
flights by airplanes, and by using a sounding rocket. However, 
the microgravity conditions created using these media are not 
sufficient for conducting experiments to develop new materials 
or for conducting experiments involving living creatures. This 
makes it essential for these experiments to be conducted in 
space. NASDA has conducted research aboard the space shuttle by 
seeking the cooperation of the United States. NASDA plans to 
conduct experiments aboard the space station projected for the 
future. In parallel with these efforts, MITI, in cooperation 
with other research organizations, has been promoting the 
development of an unmanned space experiment system (free flyer) 
and self-returning unmanned space experiment system. At the same 
time, the ministry is trying to make it easier for those 
involved in space research to use their free-fall tower facility. 
  The experiment conditions experienced under a microgravity 
differ greatly from the conditions encountered on the ground. In 
order to promote the development of space technology under 
microgravity, it is important to accumulate the sufficient basic 
data needed to conduct the experiments smoothly. With this 
understanding, MITI has been providing assistance to the Space 
Environment Utilization Research Corporation and other 
establishments engaged in the development of space technology. 
  1. Development of Free Flyer 
  In cooperation with the Education Ministry (Institute of 
Space and Astronautical Science) and the Science and Technology 
Agency (NASDA), MITI has been developing an unmanned free flyer 
for conducting earth observation and conducting experiments 
under microgravity conditions in space. The flyer is scheduled 
to be launched by the H-II rocket in early 1995. It will be 
recovered by the space shuttle that will be sent up to the 
flyer's orbit six months after the flyer's launch. During this 
period, various experiments will be conducted using the flyer, 
with the results of the experiments expected to make it possible 
for us to better use the microgravity space experiment 
environment. The space flyer will play an important role as a 
space experiment facility in preparation for the future 
construction of a space station. The experimental equipment to 
be installed on the flyer will have a modular design, which will 
make it easy to replace the equipment units and the specimens 
for reuse of the flyer. By employing the flyer for unmanned 
experiments, the experiment environment aboard the vehicle will 
be made free from the changes in gravity caused by crew 
movements. This will make it possible for the flyer to realize 
an experiment environment superior to that aboard the space 
station. Another advantage of the flyer is the availability of 
sufficient electric power to run the onboard instruments since 
it will be equipped with solar batteries. MITI plans to include 
experimental units involving three types of furnaces, i.e., a 
single heat-source furnace, a combination heat-source furnace 
and a focused-heat furnace, as an onboard experiment system to 
produce high-purity GaAs crystals. GaAs, as a composite 
semiconductor material, has a promising future for use in solar 
electric power generation. 
  The efforts to develop a free flyer are currently at the 
final stages of creating a flight model. 
  2. Development of Self-Returning Unmanned Space 
Experiment Vehicle 
  The free flyer will provide an ideal microgravity experiment 
environment. However, its disadvantages include inflexibility of 
operation since it must be recovered by launching a space 
shuttle, and safety requirements since the orbiting flyer must 
be pulled into the cargo bay of the space shuttle by the crew 
for recovery. Taking these disadvantages into consideration, 
MITI plans to develop a self-returning unmanned space experiment 
vehicle by seeking cooperation from the Education Ministry 
(Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and the German 
government. With the self-returning vehicle, it will be possible 
for Japan to launch and recover the vehicle for reuse without 
requiring the help of other countries. The vehicle will provide 
a solution to the problems encountered in the unmanned free 
flyer. Considering the cloudy future of the space shuttle 
operation, it will be necessary for Japan to develop such a 
self-returning experiment vehicle. The disadvantages of the 
self-returning vehicle are the limited supply of electric power 
and the shorter experimental period during a single flight. 
  With the development of the self-returning vehicle, it will 
become possible to launch experimental equipment with a total 
weight of approximately 160 kg for conducting various 
experiments under microgravity conditions for about a week. 
Using the vehicle, it will also become possible to conduct 
experiments to produce catalysts with better performance and to 
evaluate the performance of carbon materials by exposing them to 
the heat generated by the vehicle's re-entry into the earth's 
atmosphere. Japan has yet to master the skills for recovering a 
flying object from orbit. Success in the recovery will 
contribute greatly to Japan's efforts in developing space 
technology. 
  3. Positive Use of Free-Fall Experiment Tower 
  A free-fall tower for realizing microgravity conditions on 
the ground, offering the greatest free-fall distance in the 
world and which was constructed at a former coal mine in 
Kamisunagawa Town on Japan's northernmost main island of 
Hokkaido, was first used for experiments in September 1991. 
Construction began in 1988, with the project undertaken by the 
Underground Weightless Experimentation Center, a consortium of 
the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), local 
governments and private companies. A free-fall tower makes it 
possible for microgravity conditions to be realized repeatedly 
on the ground relatively easily. Such a facility has been very 
useful in conducting experiments in preparation for the 
full-scale experiments to be conducted in space. For this 
reason, free-fall towers are being used by space research 
centers in many countries, including Bremen University in 
Germany and NASA's (Louis) Research Center. 
  The Kamisunagawa free-fall tower has a free-fall distance of 
approximately 500 meters and can produce a microgravity of 
10[.sup]-4[/] lasting for 10 seconds. The availability of the 
tower is expected to greatly boost Japanese research on the use 
of the microgravity experiment environment. 
  Study is currently being conducted to promote joint space 
research using the Kamisunagawa facility. Regarding one such 
projected research project, MITI is considering conducting joint 
research with Germany and France to develop the technology for 
controlling furnace combustion under microgravity conditions, 
aimed at applying the technology to the development of a 
high-performance industrial furnace. As for another such 
research project, the ministry is considering conducting joint 
research with the United States to develop the technology for 
controlling fuel combustion under microgravity conditions for 
possible application to aircraft and space transport systems. 
  4. Activity of Space Technology Corporation 
  The Space Technology Corporation (STC) was founded in 1986 
to 
promote research and tests for creating and processing the 
crystals for producing composite semiconductors under 
microgravity conditions, and, consequently, to promote the 
development of an advanced electronic technology. STC, an R&amp;D 
company, is capitalized 70 percent by the Japan Key Technology 
Center, with the rest handled by private companies. The company 
has been conducting research under microgravity conditions by 
launching small TEXUS rockets produced in Germany. STC's 
research has focused on obtaining basic data that can only be 
obtained under microgravity conditions. In the research 
conducted by launching the small rockets, many useful data items 
have been obtained. In particular, a feat in which the thermal 
conductivity of InSb fluid was measured accurately drew 
international attention. It had been impossible to obtain such 
accurate thermal conductivity measurements on the ground due to 
thermal convection and other effects. Considering the fact that 
this kind of data is essential for growing the crystals used in 
producing composite semiconductors and for the processing of the 
crystals, systematic efforts must be made to accumulate such 
data. 
  When the space shuttle Columbia was launched in 1993, STC 
conducted experiments to develop new materials by participating 
in the D-2 program. (The D-2 program involved experiments 
conducted under microgravity conditions in the quarters aboard 
the space shuttle that had been hired by Germany.) The 
experiments conducted by STC involved obtaining the basic data 
that will become necessary when developing new semiconductor 
materials. The results of the experiments are expected to be 
published in autumn 1993. 
  STC is the first Japanese company established to develop the 
utilization of the microgravity environment of space. In this 
sense, STC must assume a leadership role in the effort to 
develop Japan's space industry. 
  5. Activities of Other Related Organizations in 
Promoting Use of Space Environment 
  The Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Systems 
(JSPMS) has been developing small experiment systems to be used 
aboard the space shuttle by taking advantage of the microgravity 
conditions lasting six to seven minutes that were made available 
during the launching of the small Swedish MASER rockets and 
NASDA's small TR-IA rockets. In March 1989, with the cooperation 
of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC), 
JSPMS conducted experiments on molded oxide semiconductor 
materials and conducted on-the-spot observation of this 
material's crystallization process aboard these rockets. In 
April 1992, the JSPMS conducted a second series of experiments. 
JSPMS is scheduled to conduct experiments during the September 
1993 flight of a TR-IA rocket to unravel the mechanism of the 
fluid phenomenon accompanying the boundary phenomenon. 
  On the other hand, SJAC has been involved in conducting 
experiments to grow zeolite crystals aboard a German satellite, 
in addition to extending its cooperation to JSPMS in the 
experiments described above. 
  In May 1993, SJAC conducted experiments aboard the Russian 
space ship Mir in which they grew crystals of proteins. These 
experiments have been conducted under limited weightless 
conditions. However, MITI wants the publication of the results 
of these experiments to lead to recognition by the industries 
and researchers concerned of the importance of promoting the 
utilization of microgravity conditions. 
  In the meantime, the Japan Space Utilization Promotion 
Center 
(JSUP) has been actively introducing the results of research on 
the utilization of microgravity environments conducted in Japan 
and abroad, as well as research trends. 
<H3>  Promotion of the Development of Space Plane-Related 
Technology </H3>
  In order to promote space development, it is important to 
substantially cut the costs of ferrying men and equipment 
between the ground and space. To realize this, it is necessary 
to step up the development of a space plane (space shuttle) that 
can be used repeatedly. Current efforts are centered around the 
development of space shuttle-type transport systems launched by 
nonreusable rockets. A number of countries are currently 
developing space plane-type vehicles, including Hermes being 
developed by the European Space Agency and Home being developed 
by Japan. In the United States, the development of a completely 
reusable space plane that will take off and land just like an 
ordinary aircraft is already underway. 
  The most difficult part of developing the space plane is the 
development of the materials for use in the engines and fuselage 
that must withstand temperatures approaching 1,800C. In 
preparation for the development of such materials, MITI has 
conducted a series of investigations of developments occurring 
between 1987 and 1990. In addition, MITI has promoted such 
development through the R&amp;D Project of Basic Technologies for 
Future Industries ("Next Generation Project") being undertaken 
by the government's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 
and by promoting efforts through its program for the Improvement 
of R&amp;D Infrastructures being launched by the New Energy 
Development Organization (NEDO). 
  1. Development of Advanced Super-High 
Temperature-Withstanding Materials 
  The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology kicked off 
an 
eight-year project in 1989 to develop advanced super-high 
temperature-withstanding materials as part of the agency's 
endeavors in the Next Generation Project. The interdisciplinary 
project involves researchers from the agency's laboratories, the 
nation's universities, and private companies who are developing 
materials with super-high temperature-withstanding and good 
antioxidation capabilities suitable for use in constructing the 
space plane. The materials under development include Ti-Al and 
Nl-Al intermetallics, as well as composite materials reinforced 
with carbon or silicon carbide fibers. 
  This project has attracted considerable interest from 
foreign 
companies. So far, a number of foreign companies, including 
Rolls-Royce, have participated in the project by extending 
cooperation to the Research and Development Institute of Metals 
and Composites for Future Industries (RIMCOF), an organization 
representing the private sector that is responsible for 
promoting the project. 
  2. Activities of Japan Ultra-High Temperature Materials 
Research Center (JUTEM) 
  As part of the project of Improvement of R&amp;D 
Infrastructures, 
JUTEM was established to help NEDO with the development of 
super-high temperature-withstanding materials. The center is 
responsible for making the facilities needed to produce 
super-high temperature-withstanding materials and to evaluate 
the materials developed that are available to Japanese and 
foreign researchers. 
  The center has two regional centers--one in Ube City, 
Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the other in Tajimi City, Gifu 
Prefecture. The former is mainly equipped with production 
facilities, while the latter mainly holds evaluation facilities. 
The operation of these regional centers is being subsidized by 
local governments and the companies using the centers. A portion 
of the facilities at these centers became operational and 
available for R&amp;D use in April 1991. It is expected that 
these 
centers will serve as the nucleus of regional activities for the 
developing advanced technology industries. 
  The facilities installed at these centers have drawn 
considerable attention from foreign researchers. So far, many 
researchers from foreign countries have visited these centers. 
<H5>  Promotion of Development of Space Robot Technology </H5>
  The effort directed toward space development so far has 
relied mainly on manned space programs, including the Apollo 
space program and programs involving the use of the space 
shuttle and Mir spaceships. In order to promote space 
development further, it will be essential to develop space 
robots. The robots will make it possible to perform various 
hazardous space tasks for the astronauts, including satellite 
maintenance in orbit and constructing a large-scale space 
station at comparatively low cost. 
  In fact, it has been found that the space station program 
(preparation for it is under way, aiming at starting space 
station operation in the late 1990s) will involve vast amounts 
of construction and maintenance work that will be more than the 
astronauts can handle. This has caused the program to be 
completely reviewed. 
  The need for the introduction of space robots will become 
more important in the larger-scale space station programs needed 
in the future for the exploration of the moon and Mars. 
  In the meantime, Japan lags behind Canada in the development 
of space robot technology. (Canada developed the robot arms 
currently being operated from the space shuttle.) However, Japan 
has a reached the top level of industrial robot technology, and 
its potential ability in robotics has been highly evaluated 
internationally. In 1990, the United States and France each sent 
fact-finding missions to Japan to investigate the Japanese 
situation regarding the development of space robot technology. 
As described above, international cooperation in the field of 
space robot technology has begun to be promoted in recent years. 
  Under these circumstances, MITI plans to start research on 
space robot technology so that it can evaluate the fundamental 
technology needed to create space robots by taking advantage of 
the launch of technology evaluation satellite No 7 (EST-VII), 
scheduled to be launched by NASDA in 1997. 
  Joint research by Japan and the United States on a technique 
for mutual manipulation of a telerobot installed a very long 
distance away was scheduled to start in 1993. 
<H5>  Study of Electric Power Generation System in Space </H5>
  Amid the mounting concern in recent years about the 
deterioration of the earth's environment, the Japanese 
government has announced that it will make an effort to 
formulate a plan to save the earth from aggravating 
environmental pollution, that it will promote the transfer of 
environment-related technologies to developing countries, and 
that it will promote the development of new energy-related 
technologies that may prevent environmental pollution from 
causing further aggravation. The space electric power generation 
scheme involves generating electric power using solar energy, 
and transmitting the electric power thus generated to ground 
stations in the form of microwave energy. This energy generation 
system represents one of those new energy generation methods 
being studied for possible introduction in the future in our 
effort to save the earth from environmental destruction. In 
order to realize electric power generation from space, a number 
of problems must be resolved. These problems include the 
development of a technology for constructing a large-scale 
electric power generation system in space, grasping the effects 
on the earth's environment of using microwaves to send the 
electric power generated, and reducing the cost of constructing 
such a system. Technologically, however, a major hurdle has 
almost been cleared, and it is highly possible that electric 
power generation from space will be realized. Since 1991, MITI 
has been conducting surveys on space electric power generation 
system development in Japan and abroad, on the technological 
possibilities of constructing such systems, and on their 
economic viability. 
<H5>  Study of Launching Rockets on Commercial Basis </H5>
  As a result of the progress being made in recent years in 
the 
commercial utilization of communications and broadcasting 
satellites worldwide, rockets for placing these satellites in 
orbit are beginning to be launched on a commercial basis by 
Ariane Space Corporation and other companies. In the meantime, 
with the appearance of a company established to procure rockets 
and launch them for its customers, it will become possible to 
launch rockets on a commercial basis in Japan. The company was 
founded by setting sights on the launch of the H-II rocket that 
is under development by NASDA. 
  However, in order to make it possible to launch rockets on a 
commercial basis in Japan, a number of problems must first be 
solved. These problems include revising the space law with 
respect to clauses defining the responsibility of third parties, 
improving the rocket launch center utilization system, 
transferring rocket-related technologies currently held by 
governmental organizations, adjusting interests with fishermen, 
and developing the demand to ensure that rocket launching will 
continue on a commercial basis. 
  Since 1993, MITI has been making an effort to realize the 
launching of domestically-developed rockets on a commercial 
basis. 
<H3>  Survey of Situation of Development of Next-Generation 
Commercial Satellites and Their Utilization </H3>
  The need for developing next-generation commercial 
satellites 
has been mounting in recent years. For example, in the case of 
satellites for observing the earth's environment, disaster areas 
and conditions on the ground, the next-generation satellites 
will make it possible to establish more sophisticated earth 
observation systems that will allow observation to be realized 
at greater frequencies. However, many problems must still be 
solved before development can proceed. These problems include 
who will develop and operate the satellites, how the satellite 
services will be operated, and other problems expected to be 
encountered in promoting international cooperation in the 
development and utilization efforts. 
  In preparation for such development, MITI has been 
conducting 
surveys since 1991 on the situation in Japan and abroad with 
respect to the development of advanced commercial satellites, 
focusing on ones to be used in earth observation. Parallel to 
this, the ministry has been studying the measures it will 
introduce to promote the development and use of the satellites 
on a commercial basis. 
<H5>  Problems MITI Must Tackle To Promote Space Development </H5>
  So far, this report has introduced the current situation in 
the Japanese space industry that is experiencing a turning point 
in various respects, and the efforts MITI has been making to 
promote space development. There are still many problems that 
must be tackled in promoting the commercial utilization of space 
technology and international cooperation. 
  These problems include: 
  1. Improvement of the Industrial Infrastructure for 
Better Market Competitiveness 
  The space industry depends heavily on government subsidies. 
The Japanese space industry has not had sufficient 
commercial-base experiences in its activities. Taking these 
things into consideration, it is important for the industry to 
promote the use of parts and hardware systems in actual space 
applications, and to accumulate data on the results of actual 
use. Improvement must also be made in the production and test 
systems necessary to produce satellites and rockets. In 
addition, the industry must formulate a corporate strategy that 
will take international cooperation and the international 
division of space development tasks into account. 
  2. Promotion of Utilization of Space Technology 
  An urgent task involves developing a technology that will 
promote the use of the data obtained from the remote-sensing 
satellites in industrial applications, and reforming the 
administrative system to facilitate the commercial use of the 
data. It is important to promote experiments in microgravity 
conditions, including experiments using free-fall towers. 
Efforts must be made to develop the demand for ground-use as 
well as space-use equipment and systems. 
  3. Establishment of Framework for Commercial Use of 
Space 
  The industry must strengthen competitiveness in the 
international market. At the same time, the Japanese government 
must take measures to promote space development and the 
utilization of space technology in the private sector. Such 
measures would include the legislation of laws governing the 
commercial launching of rockets in compliance with the space 
treaty and ensuring the availability of rocket launch centers 
that can be used year-round.
