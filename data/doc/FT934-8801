FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Jessups makes sharp upturn
JESSUPS, the Romford, Essex-based motor dealer, yesterday announced a sharp
upturn in pre-tax profits from Pounds 317,000 to Pounds 547,000 for the six
months ended August 31 1993.
This represents the second part of a 16 months accounting period and takes
the profit total for 12 months to Pounds 707,000 compared with Pounds
506,000, on turnover up from Pounds 75.85m to Pounds 92.1m. This compares
with a peak of Pounds 2.8m in 1988-89.
Mr Ron Joseph, managing director, said profit prospects looked pretty good,
but that there was 'really no pattern to the economic pick up.' He thought
there was some pre-budget concern from the public that was holding back car
purchases, but on the whole he was bullish about prospects.
Mr Joseph said that the cost of dealership closures, management changes and
start up costs would probably total between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds
400,000. The group's franchises presently cover Ford, Volvo, Peugeot, Rover,
Nissan and Saab.
The directors said that given the current state of the market, they had
adopted a cautious approach to dividend policy. The second interim dividend
is the same as the first at 1.5p. The total for last year was 4.5p.
After-tax profits come through at Pounds 435,000 (Pounds 474,000) and basic
earnings per share at 0.54p (1.05p) affected by a more normal tax charge for
the year.
