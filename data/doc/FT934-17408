FT  01 OCT 93 / Row looms on EC waste plans
THE UK will try to block a new European directive on waste disposal at next
Tuesday's European Council meeting in Luxembourg, Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, said yesterday.
The European Commission should not attempt 'pseudo-harmonisation' of
environmental standards which could 'properly be dealt with by member states
themselves', he said. Mr Yeo has been an outspoken advocate of subsidiarity
 -the devolution of decision-making to the lowest possible national,
regional or local level.
The UK objects to the EC plans to tighten rules on landfill, involving the
disposal of waste by burying it. The proposed directive would restrict the
practice, common in Britain, of burying industrial waste together with
organic household rubbish.
Some EC countries argue that the chemical reactions produced by this method
of 'co-disposal' are dangerous. The UK will argue that the reactions make
the hazardous industrial waste safer.
However, the UK intends to throw its weight behind the EC's controversial
plans for a directive on recycling packaging, which are also likely to
provoke a row on Tuesday.
The German scheme, which insists on manufacturers taking back all packaging,
has been close to bankruptcy, and has generated mounds of unwanted recycled
plastic and paper. The pollution inspectorate has made a deficit on its
budget for the second year running. The deficit for the year to March 1993
was Pounds 2.1m, just under 10 per cent of the inspectorate's income. A rise
in fees and charges to companies and government departments resulted in a
lower deficit than the previous year's shortfall of Pounds 3.1m.
The inspectorate is nearly half-way through a five-year programme of
licensing the UK's 5,000 most polluting industrial installations according
to the terms of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act.
