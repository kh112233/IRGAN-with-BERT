FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tiphook secures further finance
TIPHOOK, the debt-laden UK container and transport leasing group, has
obtained further facilities from its bankers and is in talks with an
unidentified third party about the possible sale of its container division.
The group has been struggling to refinance its overstretched balance sheet
and warned the costs of refinancing meant it was likely to make a loss in
the second half.
Tiphook said it did not expect to pay a dividend.
Tiphook has an estimated 17 per cent of the world's container rental fleet,
making it the second largest rental company in the world after Genstar, a
division of the US's General Electric Capital Corporation.
The container division, which accounted for more than half of Tiphook's
turnover last year, could fetch a substantial sum, although trading activity
is at a low point.
Tiphook said it was at a preliminary stage of discussions of various
alternatives with other parties.
This, combined with the container division talks, suggests the group's
bankers might be considering an orderly disposal of all the group's assets.
Tiphook recently obtained shareholder approval to allow debts to increase to
Pounds 1.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn), giving gearing of 600 per cent.
An obstacle to speedy disposals could come from disgruntled US bondholders,
who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m in the last year.
