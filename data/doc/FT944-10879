FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Snake charmers win new rights
India will offer copyright protection to jugglers and snake charmers under
an amended copyright law to enforce intellectual property rights. The rules
flesh out a law passed in May to protect creativity and would be formally
notified soon, Mr YN Chaturvedi, from the Human Resource Development
Ministry, said. He said special police units would be set up nationwide to
check infringement of the law, passed to strengthen the new General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade pact.
India has framed the law to ensure Indian artistes and performers are not
cheated in copyright purchases, he said.
