FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Robot lifts the load
A robot fork lift truck that carries loads between lorry trailer and factory
floor could extend automation to the loading bay. A prototype now being
tested maps its surroundings continuously and plots its routes.
'There is no system in the world that loads and unloads conventional
trailers fully autonomously,' says Malcolm Roberts, director of Guidance
Control Systems of the UK. 'We built a system four years ago that relied on
mirrors in the trailers to reflect positioning lasers but now we don't need
them.'
Drivers of trailers up to 16m long cannot park them accurately enough for a
fixed robot loader to work. The GCS robot copes with such variables and also
detects changes in its surroundings - for instance, when a pallet is in its
path. A central computer communicates the tasks by radio to the robot, which
is otherwise autonomous.
The robot uses a variety of sensors to detect its own location and the
trailer. A laser system scans ahead up to 25m; for local positioning,
ultrasound is accurate for between 20cm and 2m. The ultrasound data is
interpreted quickly by an off-the-shelf transputer but an infra-red sensor
cuts in when data of a higher resolution is needed - to cope with an
odd-shaped load, for example.
The robot analyses when it has nudged up close to a load using a force
sensor and torque measurement on each wheel. More sensors control the
sideways movement of the forks so that loads are deposited hard up against
the trailer wall.
'A fork-lift truck driver can unload a trailer in half an hour with relative
ease and our prototype hasn't yet shown it can work so quickly. We expect to
be there later this year,' says Roberts.
However, time is not the only cost factor as robots are not so prone to
accidental damage to loads.
