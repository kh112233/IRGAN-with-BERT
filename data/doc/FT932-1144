FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots active
Fears over US litigation - which proved unfounded - gave Boots a rocky ride,
sending the price down 9 at one stage before the company moved to quash talk
that its troubled Manoplax heart drug faced action. 'It was an entirely
fictitious rumour and one that caught Boots when market sentiment towards it
is low,' said one analyst. Boots' reassurances brought the stock back to
close just 2 lower at 437p in modest volume.
The market was shocked but not completely surprised by the latest profits
warning, the third in 12 months, issued by Spring Ram, the building
materials to bathrooms group. Spring Ram shares, which were driven down 8 to
61p late on Tuesday, plummeted to 50p as the latest warning was issued, but
later stabilised and closed a net 8 1/2 cheaper at 52 1/2 p. Turnover in the
shares was a heavy 7.8m.
The switch recommendation, out of RMC and into Redland saw the latter move
up 10 more to 466p and the former slide a further 7 to 743p.
The latest asset sales by BP, including the sale of Purina Mills, its US
animal feeds group, for Dollars 425m, came as no surprise to the market and
BP shares eased 1 1/2 to 312p on routine turnover of 5.3m. The recent
bearish note issued by NatWest Securities kept British Gas under pressure
and the stock dipped 5 to 300 1/2 p.
The 13 per cent increase in the dividend total announced by Norweb, the
latest of the regional electricity companies to report preliminary figures,
came as a considerable disappointment to a market accustomed to the 'recs'
leap-frogging each other to pay higher and higher dividends.
Three 'recs' have already reported, with East Midlands lifting the dividend
by 14 per cent and Manweb and South Wales increasing their payments by 15
per cent.
Norweb shares dropped 17 to 480p after the figures were announced. Other big
losers in the sector included South West Electricity (due to report this
morning), down 13 at 458p, and Yorkshire (which reports tomorrow), off 8 at
488p.
The pharmaceuticals/chemical sectors remained one of the market's most
active areas, with the big stocks coming under renewed downside pressure
primarily because of the Goldman Sachs downgrade of Glaxo late on Tuesday.
The Goldman move triggered a fresh wave of selling in the pharmaceuticals on
Wall Street.
Glaxo continued to bear the brunt of the selling, the shares sliding to 577p
at one point before finishing a further 8 1/2 off at 579p, for a two-day
loss of 19 1/2 . Turnover was 6.3m.
The weakness spilled over into other drug shares, with SmithKline Beecham
finally 12 lower at 434p after turnover of 2.5m. Wellcome's recent
underperformance, triggered by worries about the challenge to US patents on
Retrovir, expected to commence next week, and the cancellation of a clinical
study of its Flofan drug, saw the stock price retreating sharply to close 23
down at 686p after much higher than usual turnover of 4m.
Zeneca, sustained by the successful outcome of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue
and Tuesday's placing of the rump of the rights at 612p, held at 626p. ICI,
whose shares raced ahead after the Zeneca demerger, came under renewed
pressure, closing 10 1/2 weaker at 681p.
The strong buying of Fisons gathered pace, driving the shares up 5 more to
182p.
Medeva shares were given a mauling, retreating to 209p before rallying to
close a net 10 lower at 213p.
Against the market trend, Kingfisher moved forward 13 to 613p.
Another bout of enfranchisement rumours helped to buoy GUS 'A' shares,
sending them ahead 28 to 1745p.
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, attracted heavy buying interest from London
and overseas investors, the shares moving up 4 to 198p after turnover of
6.1m, the heaviest single day's business this month.
Unable to reverse its downward trend, United Biscuits fell a further 6 1/2
to 396p on a BZW sell note and ever more ebbing rumours of a bid.
A return to trading with a Pounds 16.4m cash call did not inspire confidence
for Alexon, the women's wear retailer, and its shares tumbled 13 to 65p.
A fresh property cash call found an unresponsive market and sent down the
shares of Frogmore Estates 17 to 404p after it asked for Pounds 42.9m via a
rights issue at 345p.
With its debut on the market, Carpetright, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail
chain, proved the most highly traded stock with a volume of 22m, although
its performance was greeted by some analysts as being more due to marketing
than fundamental value. The stock jumped 17 1/2 to 165 1/2 p.
