FT  28 MAR 92 / Obituary: John Brennan
JOHN BRENNAN, whose informative and entertaining analysis of the residential
property market became one of the cornerstones of the Weekend FT, died last
week.
John, who was 42, wrote with flair, insight and authority on a subject
attracting more than its fair share of armchair experts.
An intensely professional man, he was a journalist of absolute integrity.
John never regarded his column for the Weekend FT, which he contributed
while running his own publishing business, as an opportunity merely to pen
graceful prose about stylish country mansions.
The topics he served up for weekend readers ranged from the problems of
first-time buyers to the challenge of coming home to find it taken over by
squatters. He never lost sight, however, of property's entertainment value,
keeping track of the latest craze for golf or marina developments or
occasionally telling readers what they could buy for Pounds 10m in central
London.
After university, John started his working life as a tax inspector before
entering financial journalism with the Investors Guardian, where he became
features editor. He joined Investors' Chronicle, becoming property editor,
and left to join The Times, where he was appointed insurance correspondent.
In 1977 he moved to the Financial Times as the paper's commercial property
corre-spondent. He left the FT in 1979 to become the first news editor of
Financial Weekly. After a spell as co-editor, he joined Bill Davies at
Headway Publications, acting as launch editor for several titles.
He left Headway, and with Ross Davies jointly founded Inc Publications,
where he was editorial director. He also created The London Magazine.
He is survived by Holly, his wife, and three young children.
