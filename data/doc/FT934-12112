FT  28 OCT 93 / Ministers to step in at 'duff' schools
THE GOVERNMENT is set to intervene in several inner-city schools after a
damning report by an education watchdog which said they were failing local
communities.
From January 1 next year education ministers will have the power to replace
local authority control of deficient schools with centrally appointed
management teams called 'education associations'.
Last month Mr John Patten, the education secretary, attacked standards of
education in inner cities, saying that many schools were 'duff' and
'debauching their local communities'. He has suggested that several hundred
schools might require education associations.
The report on schools in eight areas of England was prepared by the Office
of Standards in Education, a government body set up this year to take over
from Her Majesty's Inspectorate and to act as a regulator for education.
The report's findings included:
Good pre-school provision increased the chances of young children benefiting
from school, but this was not assured in all areas.
Many pupils never recovered from early failures to learn to read and write.
Teaching is 'superficial and lacks pace', with a good-natured atmosphere in
classrooms which 'neither challenges pupils not secures their
participation'.
School managers rarely set standards of practice, while monitoring and
evaluation of pupils' learning were 'weak' in many schools.
Arrangements for support of pupils with particular needs were 'poor', with
resources spread too thinly.
