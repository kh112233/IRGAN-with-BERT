FT  27 FEB 92 / Government accused of selling taxpayers short
THE GOVERNMENT was accused yesterday of selling the taxpayer short in the
flotation of the water companies two years ago, and of over-paying its
advisers 'in what amounted to quite a gravy train'.
Sir Terence Heiser, permanent secretary at the environment department, faced
angry accusations from Labour members of the Commons public accounts
committee of indulging in a headlong rush to sell off the 10 water
authorities and of raising Pounds 2bn less than expected.
The MPs based their aggressive questioning on a recent report of the
National Audit Office, Parliament's spending watchdog, which recommended
that state sell-offs should be planned more carefully.
Sir Terence, at times shaken by the fierceness of the criticism, said that
in his view the flotation had been a success, and more time would not
necessarily have produced higher receipts. Criticism centred on the final
value raised from the flotation of Pounds 3.6bn compared with an initial
expectation of Pounds 5.7bn. In addition, the scale of the remuneration of
City advisers upset many MPs.
Shroeders, the main merchant bank adviser, collected Pounds 7m in fees plus
a Pounds 2m bonus for the 'unprecedented' amount of work involved, and Dewe
Rogerson, the marketing adviser, received Pounds 3m in fees plus a special
bonus of Pounds 200,000 after the successful flotation.
Sir Terence explained that the size of the fees was because of the
complexity of the flotation, as all 10 authorities had to be sold
simultaneously.
Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, said the taxpayers had written
off Pounds 5bn owed to them and then given the water companies Pounds 1.5bn
in cash plus Pounds 7.7bn in tax allowances.
He said: 'All I can say is there are some countries in the world where
ministers would be put before the courts.'
