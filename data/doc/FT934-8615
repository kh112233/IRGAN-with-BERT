FT  15 NOV 93 / Accounts standards set to be tightened
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the financial reporting standards-setting
body, is preparing to clamp down on provisions and pensions valuations in
draft statements to be issued next year.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman, said he planned to develop new standards on
general provisions, write-downs on assets and on pension-fund valuations.
The details emerged shortly before the board is to issue revised drafts of
standards on pre-acquisition provisions and the treatment of goodwill in
company accounts, which are likely to spark controversy.
They come after a meeting last week of accounting standards-setting bodies
around the world, at which officials resolved to co-operate more closely and
to develop standards in collaboration with each other.
A new standard on provisions would deal more widely with the circumstances
in which companies can take a charge through the profit-and-loss account in
expectation of future reorganisation and restructuring costs.
Traditionally companies have been able to manipulate profits by writing-back
provisions they have not used, which allows them to boost profits
artificially in future years.
They argue that making provisions complies with the fundamental accounting
concept of prudence. But Mr Tweedie said that, while provisions may be
prudent for the balance sheet, they 'whitewash' the profit-and-loss account.
Separately, the board plans to tackle pension-fund valuations, one of the
financial accounting areas open to most interpretation and manipulation.
SSAP 24, the existing standard on pensions, was only introduced in 1988.
The board will also consider the precise circumstances under which companies
will be able to write down assets in their balance sheets.
