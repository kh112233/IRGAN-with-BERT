CONTROVERSY OVER LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS IN AMERICA 
I sympathize with Judge Sweet's frustrations. Prior to taking the bench, I was 
a federal prosecutor. I remember in 1980 when I started prosecuting narcotics 
cases that a kilo of cocaine went for approximately $45,000 in Miami, and that 
in early 1989 when I left the U. S. attorney's office in Los Angeles that a 
kilo of cocaine went for approximately $12,000. I also remember that during the 
same time period, a big "bust" went from a 10-kilo bust to 500 and up kilos. 
However, Judge Sweet's solution is not the answer. 
In order to have any possibility of success, we would have to legalize all 
illicit drugs from steroids to crystal methamphetamines (so-called ice). Unless 
we gave away the drugs free there would always be those who would commit crimes 
to pay for the drugs, and unless we made all drugs available to all regardless 
of age or other factors there would always be those that would make them 
available illegally. 
Interestingly enough, Sweet and other advocates of legalization never address 
the issue of logistics -- just how are we going to implement the legalization. 
In other words, who would manufacture it? Who would distribute it? Who would 
set the price? Would they be given away free? Who could buy them? What about 
addicts? Would there be a restriction as to who could buy them other than 
adults? What about foreign travelers? These are just a few of the many 
questions that need to be addressed by those advocates of legalization. 
My personal feeling is that to legalize all forms of illicit drugs would mean 
the end of our society as we know it. More needs to be done in education, 
rehabilitation, and research. In addition, we need to do more to provide viable 
alternative employment opportunities to our youth. We need leadership that can 
address this very complex issue and not simple solutions.
