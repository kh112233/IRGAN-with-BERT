FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic news fails to
prevent Dow fall
Wall Street
US blue chip issues retreated yesterday in spite of a bond market rally and
more favourable news on the economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator finished 13.39 off at
3,849.59, although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped just 0.38 to 467.01. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.07 ahead to 468.13
and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.72 to 793.52.
New York SE volume totalled 329.3m shares, while advancing issues narrowly
led declines by 1,112 to 1,001.
After ignoring further weakness in the US Treasury market the previous
session, stocks were unmoved by yesterday's rebound by bonds. Equities, at
best, could only manage to struggle into positive territory during the
morning, aided by some solid numbers on industrial production, coupled with
a tame report on producer price inflation.
The Labor Department reported a 0.5 per cent increase in the February
producer price index, but the stronger than expected reading was largely
attributed to a jump in energy prices, due to harsh winter weather last
month. Excluding energy and food, producer prices were up only 0.1 per cent,
against a consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent.
The encouraging figure triggered heavy buying of the benchmark 30-year
government bond, which is especially sensitive to inflationary expectations.
Yields fell well below the worrisome 7.0 per cent level, giving some
breathing room to equity investors troubled by a swift rise in long-term
interest rates in recent weeks.
Still, enthusiasm was restrained, with most indices showing little movement
during the first half of the session. During the afternoon the blue chips
suffered a downturn which left market observers at a loss to explain.
Among the Dow industrials, Boeing fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 ,
United Technologies Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 68 and General Motors Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 61 3/8 . The other car makers also gave ground, with Ford
down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 1/8 and Chrysler off Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 59 1/4 . On a brighter note, AT&amp;T gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52
3/8 and McDonald's rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2 .
The star of the session was Kemper, which surged Dollars 20 7/8 , or nearly
50 per cent from its previous close, to Dollars 61 3/4 . The stock took off
in overnight trading on news that GE Capital had launched a Dollars 2.2bn
takeover bid for the financial services concern. The announcement came just
as Monday's session was drawing to an end.
The buying spilled over into other financial services companies. Equitable
was Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 24 3/8 , Sun America climbed Dollars 2
to Dollars 40 1/2 and Conseco added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 58 5/8 .
In entertainment stocks, Capital Cities ABC forged ahead Dollars 11 3/4 to
Dollars 708 3/4 after announcing a proposed 10-for-one stock split. Time
Warner continued its impressive run, climbing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39
7/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 30 5/8 after
its new product line received good reviews from analysts, while Oracle shed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 .
Canada
Strong bonds and burgeoning economic confidence sent Toronto stocks to a
sharply higher close, defying the easier performance by Wall Street.
The TSE 300 composite index moved ahead 30.2 to 4,500.6 and rises led
declines by 465 to 339 after volume of 85.8m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices ended firmer, with energy up 1.0 per cent and
industrial products ahead 0.9 per cent.
