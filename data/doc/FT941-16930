FT  07 JAN 94 / Hoover's air offer hits more trouble
The Hoover free-flight promotion has run into further trouble with more than
500 people complaining to trading standards officers about a deadline set by
the company for accepting travel dates, Roland Adburgham writes.
Letters dated December 23 gave Hoover customers entitled to flights until
last Wednesday to accept one of three departure dates in the early part of
this year. But in some cases the letters were not received until the day of
the deadline.
Trading standards officers in Mid Glamorgan, where Hoover has its UK plant,
said five telephone lines had been jammed for two days with complaints from
all over the country.
Mr Steve Delahaye, the officer handling the complaints, said people were
protesting at the lack of time to accept the offer and make holiday
arrangements: 'It is very unfortunate that Hoover has given such short
notice,' he said.
Hoover said yesterday that letters had been sent out over a six-week period
but one batch had been held up and had not given people enough time to
respond. 'The company is very concerned and aware of the problems and people
are being given an extra two days,' it said.
The company launched the promotion in 1992 offering two free flights for
customers spending more than Pounds 100. It was inundated by the response.
