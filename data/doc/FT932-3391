FT  15 JUN 93 / Former head of retail group jailed for fraud
MR BERND OTTO, chief defendant in the long-running fraud trial involving the
Co op German retail group, has been sentenced to four and a half years in
jail.
Mr Otto, a former chief executive of the Co op, was found guilty on counts
of fraud and accounts manipulation involving a total of approximately DM20m
(Pounds 8m). The trial has been running for almost a year.
The court found the money had been transferred illegally to Swiss bank
accounts for the personal use of Mr Otto and other former senior Co op
executives. The charges date back to events in the mid-to-late eighties when
Co op pursued an aggressive expansion course.
