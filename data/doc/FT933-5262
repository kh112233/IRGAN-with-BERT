FT  04 SEP 93 / Chancellor's ally hits at Maastricht
MR Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and a key ally of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, yesterday urged Mr Kohl to abandon support for a fast-track
European integration under the Maastricht treaty because it risked
alienating voters.
In a letter to the chancellor published in the conservative newspaper die
Welt, Mr Stoiber warned that 'the majority of voters could no longer be won
by assuming their general creed towards Europe'.
The letter comes as his Christian Social Union launches into open battle
with rival far-right Republicans. There are municipal elections in Bavaria
this month and state elections next spring.
The Republicans, who are strongest in Germany's southern states, believe
they will enter the federal parliament next year by tapping into growing
anti-Maastricht feelings.
In his letter, Mr Stoiber wrote: 'I believe the development of Europe as a
state parallel to or above European states, which you are pushing for, is
the wrong way and could destroy the process of European integration rather
than cement it.'
He welcomed the chancellor's suggestion that European monetary union could
be delayed 'by a year or two' as a result of the crisis in the exchange rate
mechanism.
The Bavarian premier said he opposed a single European currency as 'much too
ambitious'.
He urged Germany to open a debate at the October EC summit on reforming EC
institutions to make them more transparent and accountable.
