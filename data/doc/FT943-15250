FT  11 JUL 94 / Weightless love for spacefish
There are 'astronewts' in space. They were launched, on Friday, aboard the
US space shuttle Columbia.
But in a mission loaded with 126 jellyfish, 11,200 baby sea urchin, 144 newt
eggs, 180 toad eggs and 340 fish eggs, all eyes are going to be on just four
Japanese Medaka fish.
For these orange, one-inch-long, freshwater fish may be about to provide
some answers, not just on sex in space, but on food in space too: solving
two thorny issues for manned space exploration ahead of the construction in
orbit of a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.7bn) international space station.
Due to begin in 1997, the space station should be completed by June 2002, if
governments maintain their funding commitments. The Medaka fish experiment
is aimed at developing fish breeding technology to provide the space station
astronauts with a source of high-protein food.
Scientists first tried to get rats to conceive in space, but they bounced
off one another in a zero gravity environment. However, the tiny Japanese
fish have a peculiar tolerance for weightlessness, unlike most fish, which
swim in wild looping patterns when exposed to microgravity.
They also have a short life cycle, of three months from one generation to
the next, and once fertilised, Medaka eggs hatch within eight days. This
will give the crew the opportunity to watch the fish mate and see their eggs
hatch.
But should the two amorous pairs of Medaka fish find it hard to have sex in
space, the shuttle crew will experiment with the 340 artificially
inseminated Medaka eggs also aboard the Columbia to study embryonic growth
which, some scientists say, could help research into human embryos.
