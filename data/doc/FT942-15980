FT  13 APR 94 / Euphoria shuts Milan bourse
Post-election euphoria on the Italian stock market, particularly among small
investors, overwhelmed the Milan stock exchange yesterday. It was forced to
close early after two chaotic 'pre-opening' trading sessions. There has been
a surge in activity since the victory in last month's election of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi and his right-wing alliance. Volumes traded have sometimes
overtaken Wall Street.
The stock exchange council was last night debating how to relieve
administrative pressure at a particularly sensitive moment for the bourse's
development. Tomorrow Milan makes the final move to a full screen-based
trading system. Small orders, which take as long to process as large trades,
are at the root of the problems, but the council does not want to discourage
small investors, enticed into the market by Italy's successful privatisation
programme.
