FT  30 OCT 92 / End in sight to Danube dam row
HUNGARY and Czechoslovakia have initialled a provisional agreement to settle
their dispute over the damming of the River Danube after EC-sponsored
negotiations behind the scenes at this week's EC-Central Europe summit,
reports Anthony Robinson.
Mr Janos Martony, the Hungarian negotiator, said last night that the
four-part agreement called for a standstill on damming work. The Czechs have
guaranteed to supply at least 95 per cent of the normal flow of water along
the old channel of the Danube and pledged not to operate the turbines of the
Gabcikovo hydro-power station.
The agreement also creates a five-strong team of three EC experts and one
each from Hungary and Czechoslovakia to assess the technical feasibility of
removing the diversionary dams and restoring the status quo.
Both parties also gave a commitment to submit the case to binding
international arbitration or to the International Court of Justice at the
Hague.
