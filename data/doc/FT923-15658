FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Osaka steelmaker to pay Dollars
343m for Florida mill
KYOEI Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo Metal
Industries, has agreed to pay about Dollars 343m for Florida Steel, a US
minimill, joining a long list of Japanese companies to have taken stakes in
the US steel industry.
But Kyoei, aware that most of the Japanese steelmakers have been badly
bruised by the continuing weakness of the US industry, said the completion
of the deal in October depended on agreement over the rationalisation of the
struggling US company.
Florida Steel's parent, FLS Holdings, agreed to the acquisition by Kyoei,
which makes steel bars and in 1983 established its own US subsidiary, Auburn
Steel. Kyoei believes it has accumulated enough experience in the difficult
US market through Auburn to make a success of Florida.
Kyoei, the fourth-largest Japanese electric furnace steelmaker, has been
encouraged to make the acquisition by a troubled domestic market for steel
bars. The company, and other steel bar makers in the Osaka area, agreed to
reduce production by as much as much 50 per cent in recent months to reduce
an expanding inventory that has accompanied the slowing of the Japanese
economy.
Difficulties at Florida Steel arose from a leveraged buy-out (LBO)in 1988
that was a response to a hostile takeover attempt. However, the LBO created
debt that the company has been unable to service, prompting it to seek a
friendly purchaser.
Kyoei said the 'know-how we have gathered from Auburn Steel will help us
restructure' Florida Steel, though the company will 'carefully examine
business conditions in the US' and has left open the possibility that it may
withdraw.
