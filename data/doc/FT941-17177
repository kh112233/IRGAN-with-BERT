FT  06 JAN 94 / Back to the future for VW
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, yesterday unveiled the concept car for a
modern-day Beetle at the Detroit motor show as part of its effort to arrest
its sharply declining fortunes in the US market.
The Beetle, the world's best-selling car, with output totalling more than
71m, is still produced in Mexico and Brazil. It was first sold in the US in
1949.
VW is seeking to gauge market reaction, in particular in the US, to its
'back to the future' Beetle concept, and any decision to go into eventual
production would be unlikely before the mid-1990s.
At the height of its success in the US at the end of the 1960s, VW was
selling more than 500,000 cars a year, virtually all Beetles. It was the
leading car importer in the US, before the Japanese car industry began its
assault in the 1970s and 1980s, but in 1993 sales of VW cars fell to a new
low point of only 49,533.
The VW Concept 1, has been designed by Volkswagen's Californian design
studio opened in 1991.
The body shape is derived from the rounded old Beetle design, but
mechanically it would be a modern car. The German carmaker said the Concept
1 structure was based on a chassis platform of its new generation Polo small
car.
