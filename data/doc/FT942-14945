FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Genentech profits more than
doubled
Genentech, the San Francisco-based bio-technology group, reported
first-quarter earnings more than doubled, thanks to initial sales of two new
products and increased sales of products already on the market.
The company, in which Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical group has a majority
stake, reported earnings of Dollars 38.9m, or 33 cents a share, up from
Dollars 14.3m, or 12 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales
rose from Dollars 153m to Dollars 198.9m.
The figures, released on Friday, were below analysts' highest forecasts and
the share fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 on profit-taking.
The two new products launched in the quarter were Nutrpin, a human growth
hormone, and Pulmozyme DNase for treating cystic fibrosis. Pulmozyme
produced sales of Dollars 22.4m.
Sales of the group's two growth hormone products rose 3 per cent to Dollars
53.6m.
Sales of Activase, the clot-dissolving drug for heart treatment, rose 43 per
cent to Dollars 70.2m.
Upjohn, the pharmaceutical group, reported first-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 135m, or 74 cents a share, compared with Dollars 133.4m, or 73
cents, in the same quarter last year.
Operating revenues totalled Dollars 915.9m, compared with Dollars 918.2m,
while operating income fell from Dollars 183m to Dollars 168.6m.
Mr John Zabriskie, chairman, said the sales and earning performance had been
achieved despite intense generic competition against several key products.
There was a Dollars 68m drop in sales of the anti-anxiety agent,
Xanax/alprazolam, due to increased generic competition.
Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceuticals and healthcare products group, told an
analysts' meeting on Friday that it expected to achieve a 5 per cent
increase in earnings per share to Dollars 1.42, against Dollars 1.35 last
year, when first-quarter results are released tomorrow. Sales should be up
11 per cent. Analysts' earnings expectations were pitched around Dollars
1.38 a share.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman, said that for the full year the company expected
a double digit sales increase and an earnings gain of at least 8 per cent,
excluding restructuring charges and accounting changes.
