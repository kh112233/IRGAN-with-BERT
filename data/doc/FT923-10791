FT  29 JUL 92 / Egypt dismisses claim of police torture
A SENIOR Egyptian official, responding to allegations that Egyptian police
tortured prisoners, said yesterday that a small number violated human rights
but they were tried and jailed if found guilty, Reuter reports from Cairo.
Major-General Bahaeddin Ibrahim, assistant to Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa,
interior minister, was responding to accusations by the US-based Middle East
Watch. It accused Egypt's State Security Investigation (SSI), which is part
of the Interior Ministry, of systematically torturing political detainees.
Gen Ibrahim said that some of Egypt's 100,000-strong police force were not
wholly innocent.
'But we have very limited cases where some policemen went beyond the law.
They were put on trial,' he said, adding that four police officers and about
11 policemen were in prison.
The cases of another eight officers and 16 policemen were before
disciplinary courts for 'acts which went beyond the code of treatment of
civilians'.
Gen Ibrahim urged human rights activists to visit them in prison and see for
themselves and said torture charges were based on biased testimonies of
defendants, detainees or their lawyers.
