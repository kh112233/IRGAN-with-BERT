FT  22 JAN 93 / N African birth rate falls steeply
THE population explosion in North Africa is over, according to a leading
French demographer, Prof Youssef Courbage, writes Edward Mortimer.
Birth rates in the region are falling rapidly, and European fears of a flood
of Arab immigrants are wildly exaggerated, Mr Courbage told a conference in
Brussels yesterday.
In fact, he added, the working-age population in Algeria, Morocco and
Tunisia will level off in about 2005, when the number of job applicants will
begin to decrease.
'Just as Europe's bulging baby-boom generation leaves working life for
retirement, and will need to rely on a sufficient labour force - foreign
workers in particular - to finance it, the Maghreb labour markets, where
labour will be in short supply, will be hard-pressed to meet export
demands.'
Mr Courbage, a senior researcher at the Institut National d'Etudes
Demographiques in Paris, was speaking at a workshop on Europe and the
Mediterranean at the Centre for European Policy Studies.
The decrease in fertility in the Maghreb countries is acknowledged by the UN
and the World Bank, he said, but those organisations had not yet taken the
full measure of the decline.
The UN had significantly overestimated fertility in all three countries.
