FT  28 APR 94 / Recycling target seen as a load of rubbish: Scepticism on
saving waste is widespread
Government targets for recycling household waste are unrealistic, according
to waste companies which will soon face new targets on recycling packaging.
They argue that recycling household waste is expensive and may use up more
resources than it saves.
Consultation on an industry paper about financing the recycling of packaging
ended yesterday. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has called on the
packaging industry to find ways of recycling between 50 per cent and 75 per
cent of packaging waste by the year 2000.
He also wants a quarter of household waste to be recycled by 2000 compared
with 7 per cent at present. The targets are connected, as about a fifth of
rubbish in the household dustbin is made up of packaging.
The industry has criticised politicians' emphasis on recycling household
waste. Mr Steve Webb of the National Association of Waste Disposal
Contractors (NAWDC) said: 'People love being told to recycle - it makes them
feel good. But it doesn't make environmental or economic sense to recycle
quite a bit of what is in people's dustbins.
'A target of 25 per cent for household waste is the wrong figure applied to
the wrong type of waste.'
Only a handful of local authorities - notably Milton Keynes Borough Council
in Buckinghamshire and Adur District Council in West Sussex - have made
significant progress towards the household recycling target.
Milton Keynes, which opened Britain's largest recycling plant in November at
a cost of Pounds 6m, is adamant that the process is worthwhile, but it
agrees that it is difficult to say just how much the environment has been
helped.
Whether recycling makes financial sense is only slightly easier to judge.
Mr Keith Ely, assistant director of technical services, said: 'If you can
tell me what the environment is worth I can tell you whether recycling is
worth it.'
A government report in November concluded that until economists
systematically put values on natural resources and the costs of pollution,
it will remain difficult to weigh up the environmental merits of different
waste-disposal methods.
Milton Keynes spends Pounds 100,000 a year on running its recycling plant.
The costs of collecting the waste, at Pounds 60 to Pounds 100 a tonne, add a
further Pounds 800,000 a year. However, according to Mr Ely, most of that is
recovered by selling the waste to manufacturers. He estimates that Milton
Keynes makes a profit on metals and plastics, and is at 'nearly break-even'
on paper and glass.
Most local authorities could not make that claim. The main obstacles are the
high costs of collecting, sorting and cleaning household rubbish and the
lack of customers for the waste.
Metals are the easiest to recycle, as they can be easily extracted from
rubbish tips with magnets. Industry estimates suggest that producing new
aluminium drink cans out of recycled ones uses only 5 per cent of the
resources used in making a can from raw materials.
However, despite the popularity of bottle banks, NAWDC describes many
schemes as 'struggling'. Prices per tonne for recycled glass are low
compared with collection costs partly because clear glass is preferred to
green and brown glass which is more commonly found in Britain, usually
having been imported in the form of wine and beer bottles.
While newspaper collection schemes have also spread, the paper industry
argues that de-inking newsprint is polluting, and that paper can be recycled
only three times before the fibres become too short. Moreover, Germany's
mandatory recycling scheme has generated huge volumes of waste paper and
pushed down prices across Europe.
Plastics present some of the toughest problems but Milton Keynes has had
some success with a contract to supply manufacturers.
But if more local authorities overcome these hurdles, they could undermine
the pioneers' success. Milton Keynes says the market will be flooded if more
waste is recycled.
Companies and local authorities want more emphasis on commercial recycling
and on burning waste to generate energy.
Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth also suggest that
packaging be designed to make recycling easier and that less waste be
produced in the first place.
