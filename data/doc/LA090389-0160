Mohawks fought with baseball bats and clubs outside a casino over the issue of 
gambling on the St. Regis Indian Reservation in New York state, an issue that 
has sharply divided the tribe. The clash resulted in minor injuries, but state 
police, who raided Indian gambling establishments last July, immediately sealed 
off the entire 22,000-acre reservation. Last weekend, one casino was set afire, 
leading the owner of another to station men with automatic weapons on the roof 
of his establishment.
