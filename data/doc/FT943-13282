FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Whitbread to step up capital spending
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread, yesterday underlined the brewing,
retailing and leisure group's intention to step up capital spending on its
retailing businesses this year.
Sir Michael, speaking at the group's annual meeting, confirmed that
Whitbread plans a 50 per cent increase in its capital spending in the year
to February 1994 to about Pounds 300m.
He said this was equivalent to adding six businesses the size of Boddingtons
Brewery to the group's operations or of opening a new large pub like a
Beefeater or Brewers' Fayre 'every single day of the year'.
In fact Whitbread will use its increased capital expenditure to open 40 new
Brewers' Fayres, 12 Beefeater restaurant-pubs, three more TGI Fridays and 66
Pizza Hut sites this year. In addition the group plans to add about 25 more
cut-price Travel Inn hotels.
Sir Michael also emphasised that the group does intend to acquire new
businesses for its portfolio, 'when they are a good strategic fit and when
we can buy them at realistic prices'.
However, he added, 'we have walked away from potential deals in the past
when they did not meet our criteria, and I can assure you we are resolved,
if necessary, to do so again in the future'.
Whitbread has abandoned two potential acquisitions over the past year -
Harvester and the Chef &amp; Brewer chains - because it considered the price too
high.
Commenting on the outlook, Sir Michael said Whitbread beer volumes were
ahead of last year, despite the impact of cheap beer imports from France,
which he described as 'a gross distortion of the market which the government
cannot allow to continue'.
