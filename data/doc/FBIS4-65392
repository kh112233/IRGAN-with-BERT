<F P=106> [Lale Sariibrahimoglu report: "Problem of 12-Mile </F>
Territorial Waters in the Aegean Sea"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The disagreement between Turkey and Greece 
on Athens' intention to extend Greek territorial waters in the 
Aegean Sea to 12 miles has escalated as the time approaches for 
the Maritime Law Agreement to come into effect on 16 November. 
Greek Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
yesterday that Greece's approach to the matter has not changed. 
He also stressed that "extending the Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter that concerns Greece's sovereign rights." 
  In a statement to CUMHURIYET, Greek diplomatic sources in 
Ankara have reiterated that extending Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter of Greek sovereign rights. However, 
they also said: "Greece does not intend to extend its 
territorial waters to 12 miles." 
  Replying to a question about a press report yesterday, 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has said that a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles would be 
unacceptable. Meanwhile, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official informed CUMHURIYET that Turkey would regard a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles in 
contravention of international agreements as an act of war. 
  Turkey has reservations about various provisions of the 
Maritime Law Agreement, particularly Article 3. The agreement 
was signed in 1982 and has so far been ratified by 60 countries. 
According to that article, the signatory countries are 
authorized to extend their territorial waters up to 12 miles.
