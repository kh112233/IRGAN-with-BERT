FT  16 MAR 94 / Pressure for social clause in Gatt deal
France and Italy are leading a drive to include restrictions on child labour
and forced prison labour in next month's final round of negotiations on the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, urged this week's Group of
Seven jobs conference in Detroit to press for 'a minimum of rules applied at
the international level'.
Italy strongly backed the French initiative, and both Canada and Greece,
which attended the Detroit meeting as current president of the European
Union, also expressed interest in some form of social clause to the Gatt
agreement.
French officials also expect partial support from the US, which introduced
similar protections in its North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada
and Mexico, and has been pressing similar demands in its talks with China
about the extension of Most Favoured Nation trading privileges. 'I am well
aware that the social clause is far from receiving unanimity,' said Mr
Michel Giraud, France's labour minister.
International trade union organisations have been pressing for a broader
social clause covering work safety standards, union rights and protection
against discrimination in the workplace.
But other G7 countries are reluctant to reopen the Gatt deal at this stage,
and trade experts say it is extremely unlikely that a social clause could be
inserted in the face of strong opposition from many Asian countries.
