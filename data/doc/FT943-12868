FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mail idea misses point
Sir, David Parker's argument ('Personal View, July 14) that higher postal
delivery costs in rural areas should lead to higher charges for people
living in the country seems to miss an essential element in the postal
service - it is the sender of the letter not the recipient who pays the
postage. Are the increased delivery costs to be borne purely by people
sending letters to the country, or is he suggesting that a rural dweller
sending mail from the country to a city should pay more based on increased
collection costs? There are good economic reasons for keeping a uniform
letter rate, not least the significant costs saved by the simplicity of the
system, which Mr Parker seems to ignore.
Mr Parker also suggests that 'those who would prefer a better service are
given no opportunity to pay for it unless they resort to expensive premium
services such as Datapost.' Surely Datapost is a shining example of applying
the cost-based charging system. If the Post Office can offer a 'better'
service without charging premium prices or cross subsidising other
operations I for one will be a satisfied customer.
