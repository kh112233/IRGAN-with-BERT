FT  20 SEP 93 / Lib Dems boost
A confidential Conservative poll suggests that if this year's local election
results were replicated in the European parliament vote next summer Liberal
Democrats would win eight of the 32 seats currently held by the
Conservatives. The study will provide a further boost for Liberal Democrats
at the formal opening this morning of their annual conference in Torquay.
