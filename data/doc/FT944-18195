FT  05 OCT 94 / Industrial robots 'set to soar by one third': Potential for
expansion enormous, says report
The world's industrial robot population is forecast to soar by more than a
third over the four years to 1997, according to a report published by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and the International
Federation of Robotics yesterday.*
The report, the first in an annual series, says sagging growth in robot
investment bottomed out in 1993 and numbers are set to jump from 610,000 at
the end of last year to more than 830,000 by the end of 1997. Annual sales
are predicted to rise from about 54,000 units in 1993 to more than 103,000
units in 1997.
Japan accounts for more than half the world's robot stock, equivalent to 325
robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers. It is followed by Singapore
(109), Sweden (73), Italy (70) and Germany (62).
Use of robots is most widespread in the motor vehicle industry, which
accounts for between a third and more than one-half of robots in use in
countries such as France, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and
Britain.
Though Japan now has the highest number of robots in the electrical and
electronic industry, it remains the world leader by far in the use of robots
for vehicle manufacture.
In the transport equipment sector, which includes motor vehicles, Japan has
1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers, compared with 167 in Sweden, 110 in
France and 63 in Britain.
In most countries, especially those with big motor vehicle industries,
robots are used most frequently for welding.
But in some countries machining is the most common application. In Japan 40
per cent of the robot stock is used for assembly, reflecting the large-scale
use of robots in the electronic sector.
The potential for expansion of robotics is enormous. Numbers would explode
if other industrialised countries were to reach Japan's robot densities and
if industry in general were to reach only half the robot density of the
motor vehicle sector.
If all industries in France and Britain had half as many robots as the motor
industry in these countries, the robot stock would more than double. If it
reached half the density of the Japanese motor vehicle industry, it would
increase more than 20-fold.
