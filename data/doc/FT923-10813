FT  28 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: MSE to trade new basket of
securities
THE Midwest Stock Exchange, the third largest US stock market, is planning
to trade a new basket of securities based on the Major Market Index stock
index futures which is traded at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world
largest futures exchange.
The Midwest Stock Exchange, which has filed for approval from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to trade the new product, hopes that it will lure
traders with a highly correlated hedge for the Major Market Index futures
contract.
The new product, called the Midwest Basket, is the first time that the
Midwest Stock Exchange has ventured into baskets of securities.
It will comprise the 20 stocks included in the MMI futures contract in
quantities that approximate one-fifth of the settlement value of the MMI.
The MSE hopes to begin trading the Midwest Basket in this year's fourth
quarter.
