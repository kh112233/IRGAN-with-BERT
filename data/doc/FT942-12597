FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort lifted
Bullish remarks by Lord Rockley, chairman of Kleinwort Benson, at the
merchant bank's annual meeting, triggered a burst of heavy buying for
Kleinwort shares and a general upturn in the merchant banks.
These have suffered badly in the market following the steep falls in
international bond markets in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy. Many of the big US investment banks are said
to have suffered big losses in markets.
Lord Rockley said the bank's overall performance in the first quarter was in
line with that for the same period last year. The news was greeted with
widespread relief by dealers and analysts.
Kleinwort shares jumped to 485p before ending 38 higher at 483p. Other
merchants also attracted heavy support, with Hambros adding 13 to 364p,
Schroders 30 to 1285p and SG Warburg 22 to 732p.
Consideration of BAT Industries' acquisition of American Tobacco saw the
tobacco to insurance conglomerate's shares improve 4 1/2 to 461p, while
sector stablemate Rothmans International gained 15 to 408p.
Pharmaceutical issues rebounded after a period of extended weakness. Glaxo
and Wellcome bounced 11 apiece to 564p and 510p.
ICI spurted forward 16 to 853p ahead of first quarter figures today.
Transport and hotels group P &amp; O slid 12 to 715p as analysts fretted at the
change in depreciation policy for bulk and container ships mentioned in the
company's report and accounts.
NFC shed 3 to 232p after a block of 650,000 shares was placed in the market
at 231p.
A shortage of stock sent conglomerate Hanson forward 4 3/4 to 275p after
Lehman Brothers reiterated its but stance. The US investment bank believes
the shares are worth 300p in the short term.
The oil majors attracted further strong support from UK fund managers, with
BP moving up 9 more to a record 399p on turnover of 9.3m shares. Shell,
still sustained by the Pounds 350m boost to second quarter income by a big
asset sale in the far east, added 8 at 736p.
The takeover action involving Lasmo produced interest in the smaller oil
stocks where Goal edged up 2 to 73p and Premier the same to 31p.
In a generally firm utilities sector East Midlands Electricity jumped 8 to
568p following a strong buy recommendation from the Smith New Court
utilities team.
The leisure sector was deeply divided over the latest deal from Compass,
which confirmed it is to spend Pounds 300m on buying US food service group
Canteen. It is to be partly funded by a 6-for-19 rights issue at 270p
raising Pounds 145.9m.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court was positive. 'It's in a business they
understand and substantially increases prospects for earnings growth.'
Others were less impressed, including NatWest Securities which removed the
stock from its buy list. Mr Mark Finnie said the deal 'takes Compass into
unchartered territory and raises the risk profile of the company.' Compass
shares slid 6 to 310p.
Logica, the software consultancy group, improved 15 to 300p as Hoare Govett
issued a buy recommendation. The house argues that the new management team
is well poised to improve margin growth.
VSEL, the submarine manufacturer, rose 15 to 995p on hopes of a Ministry of
Defence order.
Holiday group Airtours confirmed its intention to buy a Scandinavian tour
company for Pounds 74m, to be funded largely by a rights issue. The shares
fell 18 to 448p. Williams Holdings fell 9 to 379p on turnover of 10m after a
Pounds 267m rights issue.
