260m on R&amp;D
GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that is controlled by

than 50 per cent of its expected 1992 revenues, on research and development,
writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The company said yesterday its 1992 earnings would be between 10 and 12
cents a share, which contrasts with 1991 full-year earnings of 39 cents a
share, or Dollars 44.3m. Genentech's 1992 revenues would be unchanged on
last year's Dollars 515.9m.

Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the largest French commercial banking

General Mills, the US food and restaurant group, yesterday reported a small
drop in third-quarter profits, from Dollars 134.1m to Dollars 132.1m after
tax, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
This takes the total for the first nine months to February 23, to Dollars
402.5m, compared with Dollars 381.8m a year earlier.
However, General Mills said the comparisons were muddied by unusual charges
and earlier asset sale gains.
The group said the restaurant side saw operating profits improve by 24 per
cent in the third quarter ahead of one-off charges, while the consumer food
division advanced by 9 per cent.
General Mills shares fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 1/2 .
