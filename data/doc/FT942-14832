FT  19 APR 94 / Think-tank warns against health care rationing move
Moves to make district health authorities responsible for rationing hospital
treatment are likely to be politically unacceptable, the Office of Health
Economics said yesterday.
The health think-tank said people would see local variations in health care
as inconsistent with the concept of the National Health Service.
The report added that one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS was not
the ageing population but capital investment. Author Mr William Laing
predicted that the government may be forced to set national standards
spelling out access to certain medical treatments.
This would mean acknowledging the reality of rationing healthcare - 'which
they have been unwilling to do in the past'.
He said the NHS would face a 'crisis of legitimacy' as decisions would be
taken by unelected district health authorities which did not represent their
local communities.
Tensions were likely to arise between Patient's Charter objectives and the
priorities of budget-holding family doctors.
One possible solution was to allow GP fundholders - who were directly
accountable to their patients - to buy a wider range of treatments.
Alternatively, district health authorities should be locally elected, he
said.
