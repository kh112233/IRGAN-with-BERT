FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Denmark hands mineral rights to
the Faroe Islands
THE Danish government has agreed to hand over all rights to exploit minerals
in the Faroe Islands and Faroese offshore waters to the Faroese government.
This resolves a dispute between the Danes and the Faroes, which has been one
of the main obstacles to exploring for hydrocarbons off the North Atlantic
islands, where geologists consider that the chances of finding oil and gas
are good.
But a new dispute, this time between Denmark and the UK, is threatening to
halt prospecting.
The Faroe Islands are a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark,
but foreign and defence policy remain the preserve of the metropolitan
government in Copenhagen. The UK and Denmark are in dispute over the
territorial demarcation line in offshore areas west of the Shetland Islands
and south-east of the Faroe Islands.
According to the Danish foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
proposed British line of demarcation is too close to the Faroe Islands and
is totally unacceptable to Denmark. Denmark claims that the demarcation line
should run about halfway between the Faroes and the Shetlands.
Negotiations are taking place between Denmark and the UK, with the next
meeting fixed for October 21 in London. If the dispute cannot be resolved by
negotiation, the Danes have indicated that they will take it to the
International Court at the Hague. Until the dispute is settled, it is
thought unlikely that contracts will be awarded to oil and gas companies to
begin exploration.
There is a separate dispute over the demarcation line in the north-west
Atlantic, where Britain's claim that Rockall should be the pivot of the line
is not accepted by either Denmark or Ireland.
