FT  16 MAR 94 / Museum fee 'discriminatory'
Spain should stop letting its citizens visit its museums free of charge
because the practice of only charging tourists is discriminatory, the
European Court of Justice ruled yesterday. Spaniards, foreigners living in
Spain and holidaymakers under 21 can visit any state museum free of charge,
but foreign tourists over 21 have to pay. The European Commission took the
Spanish government to court arguing it was breaking European law by
discriminating against people on the grounds of nationality. Charging
foreigners effectively restricted their freedom of movement since museums
were 'one of the determining reasons' tourists were attracted to a country,
the Commission said. Spain said it believed its open doors policy was not
discriminatory since it included some nationals from other EU states.
