FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Scottish peeper
Scottish secretary Ian Lang, who launched his department's first annual
report yesterday, must try harder. The volume on the Scottish Office is
intended to remind the Scots how much administration is devolved to
Scotland.
But the numbers are disappointing, consisting only of expenditure figures.
Since governments, unlike companies, make great public play of their budgets
it would have been nice to know what St Andrew's House had intended to
spend. All Lang would say about that is that 'We wanted to compare like with
like'.
