FT  29 APR 94 / Channel tunnel link plan finalised
Final details of the 68-mile Channel tunnel high-speed rail link were
announced by the government yesterday.
The route through Ashford and Pepper Hill, near Gravesend, Kent, had been
left undecided when plans for the Pounds 3bn project were announced in
January.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has decided to put the link through
the centre of Ashford. A tunnel option for Pepper Hill has been ruled out in
favour of a cut and cover alignment nearer the A2.
