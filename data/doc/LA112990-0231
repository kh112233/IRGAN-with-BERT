HIBACHI FUMES CITED IN 2 DEATHS 
A hibachi being used indoors was blamed today for carbon monoxide deaths of a 
man and his small son and hospitalization of his wife and 2-week-old daughter. 
Authorities were called to the family's home at 718 N. Figueroa St. about 8:30 
p.m. Wednesday after relatives broke into the residence and found Nghip Tan 
Nguyen, 39, and his 4-year-old son, Jollivet, dead on a bed in the living room, 
Sgt. Roger Scharf said. 
Nguyen's wife, Canh, and 2-week-old daughter were found alive, lying on another 
bed, he said. They were in stable condition at Garden Grove Medical Center. 
"A small hibachi barbecue was found in the kitchen, and death is thought to be 
the result of carbon monoxide poisoning," Scharf said. 
Police had not determined whether the family was using the hibachi for heat or 
cooking, he said.
