FT  13 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Boots
Given previous hiccups, the UK authorities' decision to license Manoplax
must be a great relief to Boots. Now the hope is for full approval in the
US, so that Manoplax can be sold to treat heart failure either alone or in
tandem with other drugs. Unfortunately, even this success serves only to buy
Boots a little time. Its pharmaceuticals division has little in the pipeline
and Boots is a tiddler in a market increasingly dominated by leviathans.
The company could hang on and reap good margins and cash flow from
pharmaceuticals, accepting that it does not have the resources to become a
major force. But selling out to a larger company has a strategic logic. With
economies of scale in research and development, and the large sales forces
needed to make drugs into market leaders, a bigger firm might squeeze more
from Boots' existing products. A buyer might also improve Manoplax's
marketability by combining it with other heart treatments.
For Boots the trick is to choose the right moment to sell. Estimates of a
drug's earnings potential prior to launch are pretty speculative. A couple
of years from now Manoplax's prospects will be clearer, more clinical trials
will be completed and the drug will have started to acquire a track record.
If that proves the right time, it still leaves the question of what Boots
would do with the money. Shareholders must hope that the Ward White
acquisition is no guide.
