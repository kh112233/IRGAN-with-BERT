FT  19 APR 91 / British government accused of secretly supporting a policy
allowing mineral exploration and extraction in Antarctica
Greenpeace, the environment pressure group, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democrats, yesterday accused the British government of secretly
supporting a policy which would allow mineral exploration and extraction in
Antarctica, writes John Hunt, Environment Correspondent. Mr Ashdown wrote to
Mr John Major, the prime minister, saying he had seen the British proposal
which was circulated to other Antarctic treaty parties before their meeting
in Madrid next week, but which was not given to MPs. He said the document
showed that Britain intended actively to promote a mining regime at the
conference.
Greenpeace is pressing for the continent to become an international nature
reserve. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, protested that UK policy
would mean a moratorium on mining for a fixed term, probably 20 years, to be
followed by a minerals agreement.
