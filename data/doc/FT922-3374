FT  11 JUN 92 / Ex-Ferranti deputy chairman given 15-year jail sentence
MR James Guerin, former deputy chairman of the Ferranti group who was at the
centre of a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 600m) arms contract scandal, was last
night sentenced in Philadelphia to a reduced prison term of 15 years because
he had co-operated with the government since his indictment.
Mr Guerin, 62, who was sentenced on charges of defrauding Ferranti of
Dollars 1.1bn, laundering a total of Dollars 950m of funds and illegally
exporting military technologies to South Africa and Iraq, had previously
admitted guilt as part of a plea bargain.
In theory, the prison term, which begins in two weeks, totals 46 years on
eight separate charges, of which the money laundering count amounts to 15
years. The remaining 31 years of prison for the other seven charges are all
three- and five-year terms considered 'concurrent' with the total 15 years
in jail.
Mr Guerin's lawyer, in his closing arguments to Judge Louis Bechtle in
Philadelphia, cited a recent letter by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman seeking
clemency for Mr Guerin. Admiral Inman is a top intelligence adviser to
President George Bush and a member of the proxy board of a Ferranti US
subsidiary.
He described Mr Guerin as a patriot in the letter, referring to work on US
intelligence missions in the 1970s.
Mr Robert Goldman, the chief US prosecutor in the case, responded to the
citation of Admiral Inman's letter by calling Mr Guerin 'a self-anointed
patriot'.
Mr Jim Shinehouse, president of Ferranti's US operations, said: 'We have no
comment on the outcome of these proceedings. We will continue to co-operate
with federal authorities in their pursuit of others involved in illegal
activity and we hope all related matters can be brought to a speedy
conclusion.'
Mr Guerin, who will be under house arrest with an electronic bracelet to
monitor his movements for the next two weeks, will then be placed in a
minimum security prison.
