FT  07 MAR 94 / African task force to combat traffickers
Law enforcement officers from nine African countries are meeting in Nairobi
this week to create a regional task force to fight international crime
syndicates dealing in ivory, rhino horn, diamonds, arms and drugs.
'We need a highly mobile team of officers with the authority to operate
across borders to penetrate. . . increasingly sophisticated smuggling
networks,' says Lt Col Pieter Lategan of the South African police force's
Endangered Species Protection Unit.
The delegates, from Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa,
Swaziland, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia hope the anti-smuggling task force
will be manned and operational within 12 months.
