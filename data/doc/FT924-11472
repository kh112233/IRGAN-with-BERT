FT  26 OCT 92 / Management: Business bouquets can generate passion
Ten days ago the industry-led European Foundation for Quality Management
presented its first ever European Quality Award to Rank Xerox, the
joint-venture office equipment group.
The Japanese were the first, in the early 1950s, to introduce an award for
manufacturing quality named after W Edwards Deming, one of the American
advisers widely credited with being the founding fathers of modern TQ at the
end of the war. US industry finally woke up to the issue in the early 1980s.
In 1987, the US instituted the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award,
named after the former US commerce secretary.
Like its US counterpart, the European award is part of a broader campaign
aimed at encouraging the use of TQ principles to improve international
competitiveness, particularly against the Japanese.
Applicants for the award complete a self-appraisal using nine criteria:
leadership, people management, policy and strategy, resources, processes,
people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, impact on society and business
results.
One common belief runs through the awards - namely that quality matters to
customers and that companies which ignore it will lose out.
Bolstered by this concern, more than three-quarters of British and US
businesses now claim to have some form of quality programme in place.
However, critics suggest that many programmes are failing. The Baldrige
award, ceremonially handed over by the US president to up to six companies a
year, has become the subject of a fierce debate between US management
experts.
Critics have complained about its methodology, focus and lack of coherent
philosophy. Some have faulted it for not honouring superior product or
service quality.
It remains to be seen whether the new European award generates such
passions.
