FT  27 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Portuguese recovery forecast
Portugal forecasts GDP growth of 2.5-3.5 per cent in 1995, marking a firm
recovery from negative growth of 1.0 per cent in 1993 and an expected 1.2
per cent expansion this year. Latest planning ministry projections, drawn up
as a framework for the 1995 budget, foresee growth being led by an increase
of more than 10 per cent in exports and a rise of 4.0 per cent in
investment, thanks to a steep increase in government spending. Government
investment is forecast to increase by 15 per cent to Es702.1bn (Pounds
2.8bn), of which European Union funds will account for 45.4 per cent. Most
government investment will be channelled into in public works, followed by
education, agriculture and health. The government expects inflation in 1995
to be 3.5-4.5 per cent.
EU industrial production in June rose 5.1 per cent from a year earlier, the
EU's statistics office said. In May, industrial production rose 4 per cent
year-on-year. Seasonally adjusted production in the quarter to June was up
2.2 per cent from the first quarter of the year. The rises are mainly a
result of increased demand for capital goods and consumer durables.
The Dutch index of manufacturing orders in hand rose to 104.6 in August from
103.7 in July, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.  Meanwhile, it
reported the Danish August wholesale prices were unchanged from last month
and were up 1.3 per cent from August 1993.
Portugal's industrial production index rose 1.9 per cent in June, after
staying flat in May following a 2.0 per cent fall in April, the National
Statistics Institute said.
Germany's capital account surplus rose to a provisional DM10.1bn in July
from a revised surplus of DM6.1bn in June, the Bundesbank said. A
provisional balance of payments surplus of DM1bn in July was reported
compared to a surplus of DM4.4bn in July.
