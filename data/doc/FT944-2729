FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kerkorian wins stake ruling
Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the US businessman who is Chrysler's biggest shareholder,
was given regulatory permission to raise his stake in the carmaker to as
much as 15 per cent, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The approval, from the Federal Trade Commission, follows a request from Mr
Kerkorian to be allowed to increase his holding from the current 9 per cent.
Two weeks ago, under pressure from its biggest shareholder, Chrysler also
relaxed an anti-takeover provision to allow individual holdings of up to 15
per cent.
