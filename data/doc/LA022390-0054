HEROES NEVER PLAY A WAITING GAME 
What is the stuff of heroes? There is no scientific formula or chemical 
compound. Some heroes don't even know they have it until they are confronted 
with the crisis of fellow humans in danger. 
They just respond. Such was Vidar Anderson, the eastern Sierra volunteer 
fireman who would always be first on the scene whenever someone needed help. 
And at Convict Lake last Monday, Anderson was among the first trying to save 
four teen-agers who had ventured too far out on the thin ice and plunged into 
the frigid waters. 
Alas, this was Anderson's last rescue effort. Three of the boys died and 
Anderson himself disappeared in the dark waters. In all, seven perished. 
Anderson did not stop to measure personal risk. The kids needed him and he gave 
of himself -- all there was to give. 
"There are only so many of those kind of guys around," a friend said of 
Anderson. Another of those kind was U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 
31. Cutter's wife Terry was not surprised that he would risk -- and lose -- his 
life for others. He would not have had it any other way, she said. 
And there was Cris Baitx, who managed to survive. Baitx said he knew they 
should wait until more rescuers arrived with the proper equipment. But there 
could be no delay: "Just watching those heads bobbing up and down was too 
much." 
One thing about heroes: They don't ponder the odds or wait for more help when 
they know that wasted minutes can mean lost lives. That's the real right stuff.
