FT  03 JUN 93 / Tourism records in first quarter
THE UK TOURIST industry this year enjoyed its best-ever first quarter, with
3.6m visitors entering the country, figures released yesterday by the
British Tourist Authority show.
Tourist spending was also at record levels, up 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Visitor numbers were 8 per cent up from last year.
The increases were achieved in spite of a fall in the number of North
American visitors. Visits by North Americans fell 6 per cent to 600,000 in
the first quarter. The number of visitors from western Europe rose 12 per
cent to 2.3m - higher than in any previous first quarter.
Mr Dick Batchelor, the authority's assistant marketing director, said
blizzards on the US east coast in March had hampered efforts to attract
American visitors.
He said that much of the euphoria following the election of President
Clinton had subsided and many Americans were less optimistic about their
economic prospects. This was particularly true of the authority's target
market, the top 10 per cent of earners.
Mr Batchelor said many potential US visitors had not yet realised that
sterling's depreciation had made holidays in the UK cheaper. Some in the UK
tourist industry have criticised the authority for not giving greater
publicity to the pound's weakness.
Detailed figures on western European visitors are not yet available but Mr
Batchelor said that the Spanish and Italian markets seemed particularly
healthy. The authority would be happy to see a small rise in the number of
visitors from Germany, given the downturn in the German economy.
