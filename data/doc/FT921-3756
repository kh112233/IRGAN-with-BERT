FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown
It would be premature to advocate the stockmarket rehabilitation of
Hillsdown Holdings. But judging by yesterday's results, things were never as
bad as the group managed to make them seem. A disastrous year in the UK
poultry business apart, Hillsdown's was a respectable trading performance in
1991. If only that had been mirrored in its investor relations.
Shareholders, whose dwindling faith was shattered by last September's rights
issue, were offered the sop of a 10 per cent dividend increase, surprising
enough to move the shares higher.
Given how damaging the rights episode has proved, it is worth pointing out
Hillsdown's enviably healthy gearing of 12 per cent. Management is gradually
setting out its long-term strategy, which finally includes the disposal of
non-food businesses. But it will take more than a year of steady progress to
convince the market that Hillsdown can be trusted to play to its strengths.
Meanwhile, the case for any further acquisitions will have to be rock solid.
Despite its much fitter operational base, Hillsdown must also run fast to
overcome the handicaps of a rising tax charge and dilution following the
rights issue. Although it is hard to see the shares ever recovering their
premium rating of old, a 6.7 per cent historic yield already discounts a
fair degree of scepticism. Once the UK poultry market improves, they might
just join those of Dalgety in the dull but reliable class.
