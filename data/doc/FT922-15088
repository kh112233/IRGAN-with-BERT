FT  03 APR 92 / Shipping checks come under fire in Australia
AN INQUIRY into the loss of a Greek oil tanker off the Western Australian
coast has revealed 'substantial and graphic' evidence of deficiencies in
international checks on shipping, the Australian government said yesterday.
Senator Bob Collins, the shipping minister, said an inquiry by the
government's marine accident investigation unit showed that the 22-year-old
Kirki should never have been at sea.
The Kirki lost its bow in heavy seas in July last year, about 55 miles off
the north coast of Western Australia.
Senator Collins said the inquiry found evidence of deliberate efforts to
make the ship look seaworthy. 'I personally saw a number of the plates, and
they were so thin you could have shaved with them,' he said.
'It had got to the stage where entire sections of steel had corroded out and
had been deliberately covered up with a piece of canvas that had then been
painted over to make it look as though the original steel was still there.'
The inquiry also found serious deficiencies in the Kirki's safety equipment.
It said many of the crew could have lost their lives if the accident had
happened further out to sea.
Senator Collins said the government was pursuing the 'international scandal'
of unsafe shipping with the International Maritime Organisation, the UN
agency.
Most structural surveys on ships are carried out by classification societies
based in the leading maritime countries, which maintain inspectors in many
of the world's ports.
The larger societies, such as Lloyd's Register in London, are regarded as
highly capable. However, there has long been concern about some of the
smaller societies.
