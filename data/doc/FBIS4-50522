BFN 

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China confirmed Thursday 
that it had agreed to visits by technicians from the Voice of 
America (VOA) to discuss alleged Chinese jamming of broadcasts 
by the U.S. radio network. The move is an apparent concession 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton who made the cessation of radio 
jamming by the Chinese authorities one of the conditions for 
renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status with the 
United States. 
  "The Chinese side has agreed with the U.S. side to send 
technicians to China to talk about technical matters, such as 
the question of overlapping frequencies," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin said. However, he stressed that China did 
not jam VOA broadcasts and dismissed any linkage of the issue 
with the MFN debate. "There is no such thing as the jamming of 
VOA by China," Wu said. "The study of the technical problem of 
broadcasting frequency overlapping by the experts from the two 
sides, has nothing to do with MFN trade status," he added. 
  Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3. 
According to a U.S. embassy official, one technician has 
already arrived in Beijing and will soon begin discussions with 
Chinese colleagues "to review information concerning possible 
interference with VOA radio signals." VOA has repeatedly 
accused the Chinese of interfering with their broadcast 
frequencies, specifically those used by the network's Chinese 
service. Beijing is especially sensitive to the issue of 
foreign broadcasts and has reacted angrily to U.S. plans to set 
up a "Radio Free Asia", broadcasting into China and other Asian 
countries. China says the plan is an attempt by the United 
States to sow confusion and discord in the region.
