FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Algae to tackle global warming
Algae grown on salt water ponds could provide an energy source that would
help tackle global warming, Anna Kochan writes.
Scientists at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem have developed a technology
for the thermal conversion of green micro-algae into oil in which there is
no net addition of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Using an algae
(dunaliella) which grows in saline environments, they plan to set up 'energy
farms' in lagoons, shallow bays, and other salty areas.
Profile Technology Ventures of Jerusalem will build a pilot facility and do
an economic feasibility study at a cost of Dollars 6m over six years.
