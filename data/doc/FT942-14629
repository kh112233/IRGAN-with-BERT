FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fed blunts enthusiasm in
Frankfurt and Paris
Early in the day, Frankfurt and Paris were climbing on the rise of the
cyclicals, and interest rate hopes respectively.
However, their enthusiasm weakened after the US Federal Reserve indicated
another rise in short term interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was having a good day before the Fed interfered. The Dax index
rose 28.36 to 2,228.78 with cyclicals driving the market higher in spite of
a mixed performance in banks. It peaked at 2,234.20 in the post bourse
before the US rate increase brought it back to end the afternoon at an
Ibis-indicated 2,218.37.
This compared with an all-time Dax high of 2,284.18 last year. Mr Edgar
Benischeck, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, noted that the
climb in cyclicals - carmakers, chemicals, engineering and steels - had
brought the broad market even closer to its highs.
Turnover had risen from DM10.5bn to DM11.9bn. The FAZ index, up 9.74 at
846.88 by midsession, was just 8.79 short of the life high it touched
earlier this year: 'We only needed one more friendly day,' said Mr
Benischeck, ruefully.
As it was, interest-rate sensitive and volatile stocks were marked down in
the afternoon: Deutsche Bank lost DM4 from a close of DM778.50, already down
DM1 on a day still overshadowed by the Jurgen Schneider affair and
Volkswagen ended at DM538 after DM545 in the afternoon and a session rise of
DM20 to DM539.50.
With Daimler, the general problem was compounded by an S &amp; P debt rating
downgrade which left the shares at DM879, up just DM4.50, after a high of
DM895.
PARIS moved sharply from a high of 2,188 during early trading as hopes
remained that the Bank of France might cut domestic rates following the
Bundesbank easing last week.
The market was dragged down the Fed's interest rate signal, hitting a
session low of 2,155.58 before reaching positive territory again just prior
to the close. The CAC-40 index finally closed 0.47 ahead at 2,160.60.
James Capel, in contrast to some other brokers, issued an overweight
recommendation on France, arguing that investors will move from the interest
rate story to focus on corporate earnings growth: 'While we consider that
cash calls will continue to weigh on the market over the next quarter, and
in the short-term, potentially push it lower than current levels, we expect
the outlook on the earnings front to continue improving,' it said.
Given that many French companies are already well on the way to completing
their restructuring programmes, the broker added, there are good
expectations for growth this year. 'Already in the first quarter there has
been a marked slowdown in the underperformance of France relative to Europe,
an indication perhaps that investor sentiment is already turning'.
AMSTERDAM fell back sharply following the news from the US. The AEX index,
which had earlier seen a session high of 428.43, finished the day off 3.69
at 421.43.
The financial sector took the brunt of the losses, with ING shedding Fl 3.00
to Fl 81.50 and ABN-Amro losing Fl 2.00 to FL 63.60.
However, there were some positive moves during the session, with Nedlloyd,
in particular finding favour ahead of 1993 results expected on Thursday. The
shipping group's shares rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 76.20, making a rise on the week
of 5.25 per cent. Analysts are forecasting that the group will show a return
to profit, and expect earnings growth over the next few years.
MADRID needed no transatlantic encouragement to subside on the day. The
general index dropped 8.06, or 2.5 per cent to 310.80, but Mr Stephen Hughes
at Kleinwort Benson discounted any Fed effect, saying that the market was
quite depressed enough by domestic concerns.
The scandal surrounding the financial dealings of Mr Mariano Rubio, former
governor of the Bank of Spain, meant that the Spanish prime minister, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, can be expected to face trenchant criticism today when he
delivers his annual State of the Nation speech in parliament. Mr Gonzalez
has denied he has any intentions of ending his 11-year stint in power.
MILAN stumbled 2.3 per cent lower on profit-taking after the 15.4 per cent
advance which followed the general election three weeks ago. The Comit index
fell 18.72 to 781.60.
Turnover dipped after the records set last week as domestic funds, awaiting
lower prices, held back from trading.
Industrials, which have powered the market higher, were among the hardest
hit. Pirelli fell L131 or 4.2 per cent to L2,956, Montedison lost L60 or 4
per cent to L1,447 and Fiat was L233 or 3.6 per cent lower at L6,336.
The same pattern was seen among the telecommunications stocks. Sip fell L110
or 2.2 per cent to L4,851 and Stet L234 or 3.8 per cent to L5,852.
ZURICH was closed but the SMI index fell 3.8 to 2,869.1, reflecting trading
in Basle and Geneva. Sandoz registered fell SFr5 to SFr3,870 and Ciba lost
SFr11 to SFr933 in response to first quarter sales figures announced earlier
in the day.
HELSINKI was lower in response to higher bond yields and weighed down, in
addition, by the number of new issues announced recently. The Hex index fell
18.0 to 1,817.4.
