FT  03 MAY 91 / Bangladesh pledged millions of dollars in foreign aid
FOREIGN governments and relief organisations yesterday pledged millions of
dollars of aid to Bangladesh which was struck by the most powerful cyclone
in its 20-year history on Monday.
The cyclone has killed 37,000, and the death toll could rise above 100,000,
relief officials in Dhaka said yesterday. At least 20,000 people were still
missing, many of them swept from islands in the Bay of Bengal by tidal waves
reaching six metres in height.
More than 10m people have lost their homes, cattle and crops. Preliminary
estimates put the damage at Dollars 415m (Pounds 235m), but the final total
could be much higher.
Joint efforts by government and aid organisations to provide an early
warning system monitored by Red Crescent workers and cyclone shelters did
help to save lives, Oxfam said. More than half a million people were
evacuated from the most vulnerable areas - although many decided to stay to
protect their possessions and livestock.
The relief operation will provide a tough test for Mrs Khaleda Zia,
Bangladesh's first woman prime minister, who took office in March.
Mrs Zia must ensure aid is distributed fairly and honestly - something that
previous military-controlled governments were not renowned for.
Britain pledged immediate aid of Pounds 2.5m, with more to follow during the
country's rehabilitation.
A total of 10m ecus (Dollars 12m) will be given by the European Community. A
spokesman for the EC Commission said it had agreed to buy Dollars 9.6m-worth
of wheat and vegetable oil from Bangladeshi government stocks for immediate
distribution.
Medical supplies, tents and blankets worth a further Dollars 2.4m are to be
distributed by the Red Cross and other relief organisations. The US has
pledged Dollars 20m of medicine
The Save the Children Fund has given Pounds 250,000 for building materials
and cooking utensils. The Catholic Fund for Overseas Development (Cafod),
has given Pounds 200,000.
