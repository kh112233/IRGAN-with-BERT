FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wang sees loss as revenues
tumble
WANG Laboratories, the US office computer systems company that is struggling
to emerge from bankruptcy protection, said its revenues for the first fiscal
quarter declined about 22 per cent and projected a loss for the quarter.
Revenues for the quarter were approximately Dollars 360m, down from Dollars
461m in the same period last year.
As expected, the first quarter will reflect a loss from operations, the
company said, because anticipated cost reductions from the continuing
restructuring did not take full effect during the quarter.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1992 Wang suffered a loss of Dollars 9.8m, or
six cents per share.
'We are encouraged by our first-quarter revenues,' said Mr Richard Miller,
chairman and chief executive. 'They show a continued commitment to the
company from our customers and are in line with our initial revenue estimate
for the year of Dollars 1.4bn, which was made when we filed for Chapter 11
protection in August.'
The company said it expected to file revised financial statements for fiscal
1992 early next month. At the time of its bankruptcy filing Wang reported an
estimated loss of Dollars 139.2m, or 82 cents per share, on revenues of
Dollars 1.9bn. The company added that it had postponed the date of its
annual meeting.
