FT  21 NOV 92 / Treasury achieves Pounds 8bn target from privatisation
THE TREASURY hit its target of raising Pounds 8bn from privatisations this
year with the announcement yesterday that it had sold Pounds 1.3bn of debt
owed to it by BT and three power companies.
The sale followed a complex auction in which 13 privatised companies were
invited to compete to buy back debt they owed the government. Outside
investors were allowed to compete for the BT debt, injecting an element of
outside competition into the auction.
No prices were announced for the seven tranches of debt that were eventually
sold, making it difficult to assess how effective the process had been.
Baring Brothers, the merchant bank that acted for the Treasury in the sale,
said that on average the debt was sold at a price 1.15 per cent higher than
it had targeted.
Baring said the fact that a total of Pounds 5.8bn of bids was received was
also a sign that the process had been keenly competitive. Several bidders
and their advisers contacted yesterday also said the bidding had been very
competitive.
Seven of the privatised companies submitted offers for their own debt, with
bids eventually accepted from BT (Pounds 320m), PowerGen (Pounds 150m),
Scottish Hydro-Electric (Pounds 116m) and Scottish Power (Pounds 142m).
Two out of six banks that took part succeeded in buying BT debt for onward
sale to investors - UBS Phillips &amp; Drew (Pounds 229m) and Goldman Sachs
(Pounds 180m).
By buying back their debt, the companies will no longer have to pay the
government interest ranging from 11 1/2 per cent to 12 1/4 per cent.
