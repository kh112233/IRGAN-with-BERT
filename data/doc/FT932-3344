FT  15 JUN 93 / Security offshoots in copyright row
A LEGAL ROW over copyright has broken out between Era Security Products, a
subsidiary of industrial group Laird, and two security subsidiaries of
Williams Holdings.
A writ was issued in the High Court yesterday seeking an injunction against
the two Williams companies, Polycell Products and Yale Security Products. A
hearing is set for Friday.
Era claims that eight products marketed by the Williams subsidiaries,
including door and window locks, infringe Era's copyright. Era is seeking an
injunction against infringement, as well as an inquiry as to damages and
costs.
Mr Martin Emm, managing director of Era, said his company had supplied
products to Polycell for several years until the arrangement was terminated
in May at Polycell's request. He alleged that some of Polycell's new range
of products were being produced in the Far East and were 'amazingly close'
in design to Era's.
Mr Mike Davies, operations director at Williams, said: 'We have responded
through our lawyers saying we are not aware of any infringement but will
look at the evidence to see if we are infringing their copyright. If we are
infringing it, we would make a voluntary undertaking to withdraw the
products.'
He said the products concerned constituted a small number of Polycell's
overall range, and revenue involved was limited.
