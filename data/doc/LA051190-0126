4 HONORED FOR ROLE IN CATCHING ARSON SUSPECT 
Four North Hollywood residents who helped authorities capture an arsonist 
responsible for several fires in their neighborhood were honored Thursday by 
the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
Stephanie Sheppard-Tapper, Linda Ornelas, Jim Khavarian and Sam Silberscheim, 
all residents of the 5400 block of Bellingham Avenue, were awarded certificates 
of appreciation by the Fire Commission. 
The certificates cited the foursome for "unselfish courage and acts of heroism" 
in the Feb. 5 capture of Reunald Parker, 31, after a fire was intentionally 
started in a parking garage on the block. 
Authorities said the four residents were members of a fledgling Neighborhood 
Watch group that had begun patrolling the area after several arson fires had 
occurred. On Feb. 5 they saw Parker leaving the scene of the garage fire and 
followed him. They later led fire investigators to Parker and he was arrested 
on suspicion of arson. 
Parker pleaded guilty to 17 counts of arson on April 18 and was sentenced to 14 
years in prison.
