FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: VNU in talks on printing arm
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, yesterday identified a Dutch printing
company, De Boer Boekhoven, as a possible partner for its printing division
which has been a candidate for full or partial divestment since 1990.
The company was forced to concede that it was negotiating with De Boer after
a Dutch newspaper reported that VNU was poised to sell a majority stake in
the division to the printing company. VNU declined to comment further on the
press report or on the negotiations, which it described as being in the
early stages.
The choice of De Boer comes as a surprise because it is smaller in size than
VNU's printing division and because a foreign buyer had been expected to
come forward.
Earlier this week, VNU postponed the publication of its annual figures until
late March or early April, raising expectations that news on the
long-awaited divestment was imminent. The deal is expected to be take
retroactive effect from December 31.
VNU, whose third-party printing turnover of Fl 569m (Dollars 307m) generates
20 per cent of group turnover, is aiming to become less vulnerable to the
business cycle by reducing its exposure to printing.
The other two major publishers in the Netherlands, Elsevier and Wolters
Kluwer, have long since withdrawn from printing.
VNU will remain more cyclical, however, because of its major involvement in
consumer publishing.
