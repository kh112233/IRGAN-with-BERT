DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY -- CRUEL PUNISHMENT OR JUSTICE? 
On March 26, Mother Teresa's pleas for the life of convicted murderer Harris 
were rejected by Gov. George Deukmejian. I don't see why Mother Teresa even 
attempted to persuade the governor from killing Harris. 
After all, what do you expect from a governor who consistently vetoes any 
legislation having to do with prenatal and health care for babies in this 
state; especially low-income babies born in black and Latino families. Hundreds 
and thousands of unhealthy babies die every year due to lack of educational, 
health and nutrition programs for these at-risk infants because to the 
governor's unconcern for poor babies. 
I am not against the death penalty, but I believe Mother Teresa was trying to 
tell us something; something that we should listen to very carefully.
