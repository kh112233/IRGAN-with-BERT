FT  22 JUL 94 / People: Ligon strides out for Levi Strauss
Levi Strauss UK, the clothing manufacturer, has appointed its second female
general manager. Janie Ligon will take over at the start of next month from
her US compatriot Jann Westfall, who has done the job for four years and
returns to headquarters in San Francisco.
Ligon will be based at Levi's head office in Northampton, and will be
responsible for all its business in the UK and Ireland.
With the company for 14 years, her previous role was national sales manager
(womenswear) for Levi Strauss North America, covering the US, Canada and
Mexico. She has much deeply involved in moves to improve links between the
manufacturer and its stockists, both in terms of staff and technology. Her
aim was to manage and co-ordinate better the whole cycle from the
manufacture through to the sale of garments so as to maximise retail sales.
Levi Strauss hopes she can bring that expertise to its UK and Irish
operations.
Ligon has also worked hard on expanding electronic data interchange (EDI),
or the exchange of sales data between the manufacturer and its retail
outlets - seen as being an important trend in retailing for the 1990s.
She was previously director of operations in the US, and, from 1986 to 1991,
merchandising manager for women's jeans worldwide, having held a number of
posts in preceding years. Before joining Levi Strauss she was business
planning manager at Del Monte, and a management consultant with McKinsey in
Chicago. She has an MBA from Northwestern University in the US.
Ligon will be hoping to build on the success of her predecessor, Jann
Westfall, who has achieved an increase in sales in each of the past four
years in a difficult jeans market, and has done much to build up Levi's
brand image with the help of a high-profile, Europe-wide advertising
campaign.
