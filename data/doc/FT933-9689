FT  07 AUG 93 / Fresh challenge to women priests
THE CHURCH SOCIETY, a charity, yesterday lodged an application for leave for
a judicial review challenging the Commons' ecclesiastical committee's
support for the ordination of women priests.
Legislation which would allow the ordination of women was passed by the
general synod - the Church of England's ruling body - last November, and
approved by the committee in July.
The society alleges the committee refused to hear evidence which suggested
that the synod may have acted outside its remit.
