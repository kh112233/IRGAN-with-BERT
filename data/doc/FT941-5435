FT  07 MAR 94 / Jump in complaints over sexist adverts
A sharp increase in the number of complaints about the portrayal of women in
advertisements is highlighted by the Advertising Standards Authority's
annual report, published today.
Complaints from the public on this issue rose from 180 in 1992 (of which 52
were upheld) to 536 in 1993, 111 of which were upheld by the authority, the
independent advertising watchdog. The authority said the increase was
'surprising' and highlighted 'the need for greater sensitivity over the use
of sex and women in advertisements'.
Nearly two-thirds of these complaints were about six advertisements.
Only one advertisement broke the rules of the voluntary advertising code
agreed by advertisers and publishers. The advertisement was for Linn Hi-Fi
and the caption beside a photograph of a young woman read: 'She's terrific
in bed.  She's witty, intelligent and makes her own pasta. She doesn't have
a Linn Hi-Fi. But her sister does, and she's the one I married.'
The advertisement was withdrawn after the authority ruled that the use of
innuendo, combined with the picture, was likely to cause offence to the
public.
Overall, there was a slight decrease in the number of complaints to the
authority about advertisements over the year - down from 10,688 in 1992, of
which 1,490 were upheld, to 9,603 in 1993, of which 1,268 were upheld.
