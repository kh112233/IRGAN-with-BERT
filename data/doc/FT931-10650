FT  06 FEB 93 / Dollars 50m US plan for natural gas car: Shape of vehicles
to come
A Dollars 50m development programme that could lead to the first US
production of cars powered solely by natural gas has been launched jointly
by Ford, a Californian utility and the Chicago-based Gas Research Institute.
Another Dollars 23m (Pounds 15.2m) is being spent on a similar programme for
vans and pick-up trucks.
A fleet of 50 cars, adaptations of Ford's Crown Victoria model, are to
undergo trials during a three-year evaluation programme in the US and
Canada, during which several other utilities will also monitor the vehicles'
operating costs, reliability and other data.
Provided the cars are shown to have competitive operating costs and no
reliability drawbacks, there is a potential market of many thousands of
vehicles a year from the mid-1990s, as the federal Clean Air Act and
individual state legislation clamp down on car exhaust emissions.
Natural gas is potentially one of the cleanest 'alternative' fuels and it is
claimed that initial tests of vehicles in the programme have shown emissions
within California's requirement for ultra-low-emission cars, which starts in
1998.
Under the Clean Air Act, federal and state governments are requiring fleets
of 10 or more vehicles operating in the 22 most polluted US cities to begin
phasing in very low emission cars, reaching 50 per cent of all fleet
vehicles purchased by 1999.
While there is already a sizeable market for converting cars to run on
either petrol or natural gas, both in the US and Europe, the Ford vehicles
will have engine and other components made to take full advantage of the
fuel's emissions and energy characteristics.
The Gas Research Institute and Southern California Gas are contributing
Dollars 11.5m to the project, with SocCalGas providing the main fuelling
infrastructure. It plans to open 51 refuelling stations by the end of this
year, which will also cater to converted vehicles.
