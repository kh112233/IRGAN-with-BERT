About 70 members of a Mohawk Indian band opposed to gambling on their 
reservation staged a quiet demonstration outside a polling station as residents 
began two days of voting on whether to allow casinos on their land. The 
protesters picketed the tribal council building, demanding a halt to the 
referendum, which they said was illegal and in violation of tribal law. At a 
meeting Saturday of the tribal council, members voted to postpone the vote 
indefinitely until a mechanism could be found for traditional Mohawks and those 
on the Canadian side of the reservation to express their views on the gambling 
issue.
