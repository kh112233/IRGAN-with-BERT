FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mercury units close at modest discount
Mercury's European privatisation investment trust units slipped to a modest
6.8 per cent discount against their offer price when dealings in packages of
five shares with one warrant attached began trading yesterday.
The units closed at 468p compared with the 500p offer price with a
relatively low 2.25m units changing hands. Separate trading in the shares
and warrants is due to begin on April 25.
The Mercury trust was less than Pounds 4m oversubscribed when it closed
earlier this month, but still became the largest investment trust ever
launched. Its maximum size was set at Pounds 575m after Pounds 325m had been
raised in a placing with institutional investors.
Mr Jonathan Ruck Keene, director of Mercury Asset Management Private
Clients, said the modest discount reflected market conditions and was not
surprising. 'It is what you would expect on a day like today,' he said,
adding that the discount was in line with trading in shares of the similar
Kleinwort European privatisation trust which was launched last month.
Shares in the substantially oversubscribed Pounds 500m Kleinwort trust, in
effect, closed at a slight 4 per cent premium to their offer price when they
began trading in February but have since slipped back.
