FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Anti-abortionists linked to theft of 'The Scream'
The theft of Norway's most famous work of art took a bizarre twist this week
when two ex-communicated, anti-abortion activist priests from the country's
state Lutheran church hinted they may be connected to the crime.
Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' was stolen last Saturday from Norway's National
Gallery in Oslo. The painting had been moved to the first floor of the
gallery to allow easier access to a collection of Munch's emotionally
charged works during a special exhibition coinciding with the Lillehammer
Winter Olympics.
The theft, which took less than one minute and was filmed by video
surveillance cameras, has deeply embarrassed the government and caused a
public outcry in Norway over lax security of the country's art treasures.
On Thursday an anonymous fax linked to Borre Knudsen and Ludvig Nessa, the
two former priests, was sent to the Norwegian press. It showed a drawing of
a foetus with a woman, echoing 'The Scream', and asked the question: 'Which
is of greater value a child or a painting?'
Knudsen, interviewed on NRK national radio, said he would be willing to
steal 'The Scream' to promote his views. He suggested Munch's painting could
be recovered if the controversial anti-abortion film The Silent Scream was
shown on national television.
The investigation continues but many are sceptical about the activists'
connection to the theft and believe the pair may have sought to link
themselves to the theft in a ploy to gain media attention during the Winter
Olympics.
