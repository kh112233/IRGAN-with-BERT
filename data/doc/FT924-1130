FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: ABB acquires ESAB robotic
welding unit
THE robotics division of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering
group has acquired the robotised arc welding business of ESAB, the Swedish
welding company.
The deal will strengthen ABB's position as a leading robot manufacturer in
Europe and North America. It is estimated that ABB Robotics' annual turnover
will grow by 30 per cent to Dollars 450m as a result of the acquisition. The
cost of the acquisition was not disclosed.
The two companies have worked closely together since 1974 in the development
of the welding robotics market. ESAB has provided a delivery service for
about 5,000 ABB-designed robots.
ABB Robotics and ESAB have operated separate organisations for production,
research and development, as well as sales and service. Mr Stelio Demark,
ABB Robotics president said yesterday that both companies saw a substantial
business opportunity to increase market share and volume in combining their
operations.
ESAB said the deal would provide cost advantages through more integrated
production and administration as well as better market coverage.
The company said its disposal of its robotics welding business would have a
substantial impact on its financial results. It added that ESAB's financial
resources would be helped by the agreement so that it could improve its core
business of welding product sales in Asia and eastern Europe.
