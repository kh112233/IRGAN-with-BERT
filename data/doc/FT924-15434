FT  05 OCT 92 / Havel insists on a Czech state
THE FORMER Czechoslovak president, Mr Vaclav Havel, urged at the weekend
that preparations towards an independent Czech state be speeded up,
following a Slovak about-face which dashed plans to dissolve the federal
state by the end of the year.
Mr Havel was reacting to the initiative of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak
prime minister, who with the Czech opposition parties succeeded on Thursday
in having the federal parliament adopt a motion to draw up plans for a new
union between the Czech and Slovak republics.
This union would link the two republics under a single president heading a
government in charge of economic, defence, foreign, social and environmental
policies.
The move contradicts all post-electoral agreements between Mr Meciar and Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, which aimed to dissolve the federal
state legally by January 1.
'I fear this will lead to prolonged uncertainty,' Mr Havel said. 'The Czech
parliament should declare its intention to create an independent Czech state
and adopt as soon as possible its own constitution.'
Calls for a unilateral secession of the Czech republic from the federal
state increased at the weekend among Czech officials angered by the Slovak
U-turn. However, such a move could only legally be achieved via a popular
referendum. Recent opinion polls show that fewer than half of all Czechs
would vote to break up the federal state.
Mr Klaus, who had pushed for a break-up since Slovak nationalists won power
in last June's election, is due to meet Mr Meciar tomorrow.
