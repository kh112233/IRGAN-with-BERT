'ANGEL OF DEATH' NURSE GETS 11 YEARS 
A West German nurse dubbed "the angel of death" was sentenced to 11 years in 
prison today for killing patients with lethal injections to end their 
suffering. 
Michaela Roeder, 31, was found guilty of six counts of manslaughter and one 
each of attempted manslaughter and mercy killing. 
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence and the court's decision that 
compassion was Roeder's motive angered some members of the public in the 
courtroom. 
Unsuspecting colleagues called Roeder "the angel of death" because of the 
number of people who died while she was on duty.
