FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Hard to get a decision out of anyone
Sir, I run my own business. If a decision is required, I have to make it.
Unless the matter is problematical, I make it there and then.
I have come to the conclusion that British business employs people who,
however estimable their business administration degrees and all the rest,
lack any ability to make decisions at all.
We have a new hypermarket which just been opened here by one of our premier
companies. Three weeks ago I called and asked if it could let me have some
empty boxes. The perfectly polite middle management member to whom I spoke
was quite unable to make a decision.
In the end I wrote to the company chairman - a decision was made.
A few days ago I called a big international brewer in the Midlands and asked
a question. The person to whom I spoke was quite unable to decide to whom I
should address it.
Shortly after, I called at the Courage Berkshire Brewery and asked if it
could supply me with something I wanted for a charitable purpose. The person
to whom I spoke (who displayed an interest in the matter which could not
have been measured on any known scale) was quite unable to make a decision
and made the absurd suggestion that I wrote to him about it.
As William Brown said, 'strordinary.'
So, I decided to write to you about the apparent inability of British
business people to make decisions about anything. They should be taught how
to do so.
