FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: RJ Reynolds starts work on
factory in Warsaw
R. J. REYNOLDS Tobacco International has started work on a Dollars 33m
cigarette factory in Piaseczno near Warsaw which is due to come on stream in
the middle of next year and have an annual production capacity of 8bn
cigarettes.
The decision to build the plant is in contrast to the strategy of its rival
Philip Morris which has offered to purchase the Krakow tobacco works which
accounts for around one third of the country's output.
Philip Morris, which recently bought the Czech cigarette monopoly, has a
long-standing link with Krakow where it has has produced its Marlboro brand
under licence since 1973. Last year output of Marlboro in Krakow reached 2bn
cigarettes and Philip Morris is offering to invest Dollars 200m in the plant
on top of the purchase price.
The country's five state owned plants last year produced 90bn cigarettes
while an estimated 10bn cigarettes are imported, many of them as contraband.
