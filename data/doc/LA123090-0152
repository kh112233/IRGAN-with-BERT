CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
MONTEREY; 
PLANS FOR NATIVITY SCENE UP IN THE AIR 
A disputed creche survived the holiday season. But Civic Club members who 
removed the life-size Nativity figures from the City Hall lawn on Saturday 
under a judge's order said they don't know whether it will be displayed next 
year. 
"It just seems like a lot of trouble over nothing. In our club, we don't preach 
anything, no politics, no race, no religion," said Evelyn Hinckley, a 
spokeswoman for the Monterey Civic Club, which sponsors the Nativity scene. "We 
are law-abiding citizens. We did not mean to start a tempest in a teapot." The 
City Council on Friday ordered the creche removed or reassembled with secular 
displays, such as a Santa Claus or reindeer. The vote was taken after a U.S. 
judge temporarily barred the scene because it violated the constitutional 
requirement of separation of church and state. The Civic Club decided against 
reassembling it. The American Civil Liberties Union sought the temporary 
restraining order on behalf of several plaintiffs, including 13-year-old Victor 
Ringel; Unitarian Church ministers Fred and Margaret Keip and the Rev. J. Kevin 
Phillips, an Episcopal priest. U.S. District Judge William Ingram, who issued 
the temporary restraining, gave the city three days to decide what to do.
