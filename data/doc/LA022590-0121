LEGALIZE DRUGS 
Anti-drug war crusaders and libertarians collected more ammunition in the pages 
of The Times on Feb. 13. First, California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas 
called attention to the fact that drug cases are "swamping the courts," pushing 
aside important civil cases. 
Then the San Diego local section graphically revealed, in picture and word, 
what happens when narcotics officers raid the wrong house: splintered doors, 
broken furniture and terrified citizens, innocent of any wrong-doing. 
Significantly, though, they will reimburse damages, they never apologize. 
Apparently, they're just doing their jobs, no apologies necessary. 
It won't take much more of this to turn a few more minds toward the common 
sense solution: Legalize drugs and let the courts handle the civil cases, let 
the police chase real criminals, and let ordinary citizens rest secure that 
their doors will not be bashed in by the drug police.
