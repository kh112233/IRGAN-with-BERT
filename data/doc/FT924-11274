FT  27 OCT 92 / Britain attacks World Bank over Indian project
THE World Bank's handling of the Sardar Sarovar project in India's Narmada
valley has raised questions about its commitment to public accountability,
the British government said yesterday.
In an unusual public criticism of the bank's management, the Overseas
Development Administration said normal processes for monitoring
implementation of projects had failed. It hoped it would not be necessary
again to commission an independent review of a bank-funded project.
Following a report by Mr Bradford Morse, a former administrator of the
United Nations Development Programme, and Mr Thomas Berger, a former
Canadian Supreme Court judge, the World Bank's executive board decided on
Friday to continue funding the project, subject to a rigorous performance
review next April.
The board had considered whether to halt financing. However, Mr David
Peretz, UK executive director of the bank, said that since India intended to
proceed with or without support, continued Bank involvement offered the best
hope for rescuing the project.
Mr Peretz said the Morse report was a serious indictment of the Indian
authorities and the Bank's management. The Bank's own guidelines on
resettlement were repeatedly ignored; timetables for environmental impact
assessments had not been met; compliance with legal covenants was lax; there
was no effective consultation with those affected.
Mr Peretz told the board: 'The pattern of inadequate supervision and
enforcement fits in with concerns we have expressed for some time about the
Bank's capacity to monitor large or complex projects.'
