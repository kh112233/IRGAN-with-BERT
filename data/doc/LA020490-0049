NEWSPAPERS MAKE A GOOD MULCH 
Old newspapers create a problem when they fill up landfills and clutter 
basements and garages. But there is a good use for old newspapers that helps 
bring about a more productive, weed-free garden. 
A mulch of shredded newspapers conserves moisture, moderates temperatures and 
discourages weed growth. It can also shelter seedlings from sun, wind and rain 
on exposed soil. The paper generally decomposes gradually into soil-enriching 
humus by the end of the season. 
Newspaper strips mixed with grass clippings soak up excess moisture to 
encourage an airy, open texture in compost piles. The high-carbon newsprint 
rots readily in combination with the high-nitrogen clippings, and household 
waste such as fruit and vegetable peelings, egg shells, coffee grounds and tea 
leaves. 
Newspapers generally contain 75% ground wood pulp and 25% purified fiber or 
cellulose. Wood pulp contains the nutrients and trace elements that were in the 
trees originally. Newsprint ink is made from carbon black and mineral oil and 
is not harmful to plants or microbial soil life. 
Newspapers are said to be rich in carbohydrate energy and have been 
successfully fed to cattle by agricultural researchers at several university 
experiment stations. 
But researchers advise against using color newspaper inserts and magazines in 
gardens. 
Newspaper shredders are available. One that reportedly quickly slices 
newspapers -- up to 12 thicknesses at once -- into half-inch ribbons features 
self-sharpening circular blades. For information, write The Kinsman Co., River 
Road, Point Pleasant, Pa. 18950.
