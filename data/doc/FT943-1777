FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BrightReasons coming to market with Pounds
70m tag
BrightReasons, the private company which owns the Pizzaland restaurants
chain, is planning to come to market after its annual results are published
late next month.
The group, which is expected to be capitalised at about Pounds 70m, plans to
clear its debts of more than Pounds 15m and raise a small amount of
additional capital in order to maintain its growth rate.
As well as 117 Pizzaland outlets, the group owns a chain of 32 Bella Pasta
restaurants and 17 Pizza Piazzas.
Mr Michael Guthrie, group founder and chairman, said yesterday that
Pizzaland, which has an average spend of Pounds 6 a head, was represented in
80 towns and cities in the UK. There were 100 other places with the right
profile to launch a new branch.
Bella Pasta, which Mr Guthrie claimed was the only pasta chain in the
country, could expand to a further 100 sites, and Pizza Piazza to a further
25.
The group made operating profits of Pounds 4.07m in the nine months to June
30 on sales of Pounds 56.1m. It paid interest of Pounds 1.19m.
Mr Guthrie, a former chairman and chief executive of Mecca Leisure, started
the group with the purchase of a chain of 136 lossmaking restaurants from
Grand Metropolitan for Pounds 16m in 1991. A further 44 restaurants were
purchased from Rank early last year.
The pizza chain was given a more European feel and a wider range of menu,
and returned a small profit in its first year.
Mr Guthrie said the UK market for pizza and pasta restaurants had grown by
more than 25 per cent in real terms since 1986, and he expected further
strong growth as eating out continued to become more popular.
The main shareholders in BrightReasons are Mercury Asset Management, with 53
per cent, and the management, with 29 per cent.
Some of the management will be selling shares, but Mr Guthrie will not be
selling any of his 8 1/2 per cent stake.
Sponsors to the issue will be Samuel Montagu, and UBS is broker.
