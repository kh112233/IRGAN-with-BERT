FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Norcor planning flotation by June
Norcor, a corrugated board maker based in Norwich, Norfolk, is planning to
float on the stock market by June. It hopes to raise sufficient new money to
repay Pounds 17.5m debt, while loan notes totalling a similar amount are
likely to be converted into equity.
Once floated, the group should be capitalised at between Pounds 35m and
Pounds 40m and be ungeared. However, Norcor, originally Norwich Corrugated,
plans to spend Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m on a complete rebuild of one of its
four machines over the next two years, which will require debt finance.
UBS, the sponsor to the issue, is also the parent of Phildrew Ventures, one
of Norcor's largest investors following a Pounds 36m management buy-out in
1989. Phildrew and other backers will retain their shareholdings in the
group.
Norcor is the second largest force in the 'sheet feeder' market, buying
paper, making corrugated board and selling it to box manufacturers.
Profits have been fairly static through the recession, with operating
profits of Pounds 3.85m in 1993, compared to Pounds 3.76m in 1990. But
interest charges have kept the group in losses over that period.
The MBO failed to meet profit targets and was refinanced in 1991, with a
Pounds 2.5m equity injection and debt rescheduled.
