  [Text] Baku, May 24 (AFP)--Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev said Tuesday that negotiations with Western oil companies 
for a production-sharing agreement would continue but that 
national interests would be protected. 
  He said the "preservation of Azerbaijan's interests" would 
remain paramount in developing the multi-billion dollar project. 
  Aliyev also moved to reassure members of the western 
consortium hoping to develop two offshore oil fields with 
estimated recoverable oil reserves of 4.4 billion barrels. 
  "We are taking very important and responsible steps in 
preserving the interests of Azerbaijan but the western (oil) 
companies will also benefit," Aliyev said at the opening of the 
International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition and conference in 
the Azerbaijani capital Baku. 
  A senior consortium source said Aliyev's speech was "very 
encouraging." 
  The western oil consortium headed by British 
Petroleum/Statoil with 36.7 percent also comprises Amoco (24.3 
percent), Pennzoil Co/Ramco Oil Services (17 percent), Unocal 
Corp (16 percent), McDermott (three percent) and the Turkish 
Petroleum Company (3 percent). 
  The western consortium has been negotiating the production 
sharing agreement with Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR for 
over three years -- an unusually long time in normal oil 
negotiating terms. The last round of negotiations in Istanbul 
wound up last week without result. 
  Negotiations will resume next month.
