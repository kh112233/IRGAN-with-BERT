FT  04 SEP 93 / Channel train prepares for test run
THE EUROSTAR, Britain's first Channel tunnel express train, has been rolled
out for engineering tests before making its debut run, Tim Burt writes.
Once checks have been completed operating tests will start amid some secrecy
in late-night runs between Aston and Lichfield in the Midlands.
The first train, of which 10 carriages are ready, is being prepared in
Birmingham by Metro-Cammell, a subsidiary of Anglo-French engineering group
GEC Alsthom.
Workers at the plant are assembling 14 further trains for the Channel tunnel
fleet, ordered by British Rail, SNCF of France and SNCB of Belgium at a cost
of Pounds 24m each.
After the tunnel's opening next summer 38 Eurostar trains will link European
cities at speeds of up to 180mph. Services to London, however, will operate
at lower speeds until the delayed Channel rail link is completed.
