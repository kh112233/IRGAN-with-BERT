FT  26 FEB 92 / CIS states give pledge on arms cuts
THE SUCCESSOR states to the Soviet Union have promised to agree by the end
of May on a share-out of the weapons cuts to which Moscow committed itself
under the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, a Nato official
said yesterday.
At a meeting with Nato and east European countries in Brussels last Friday,
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) promised to
re-allocate the weapons reductions in time for a special conference at the
end of May, in the hope that the CFE treaty could come into force by this
summer's Helsinki conference.
The five other members of the defunct Warsaw Pact have ratified the CFE
pact, as have 11 Nato countries; the remaining five Nato members expected to
do so very soon. But it is a tall order for the CIS states to settle their
raging quarrels about redistributing Soviet military resources within the
next three months.
The CFE treaty, setting geographic ceilings on tanks, artillery, combat
aircraft and helicopters, covers the territory of eight CIS members.
However, three of these - Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan - are outside the CIS
joint military command.
The treaty was negotiated on the basis of the old Soviet military districts,
whose boundaries do not coincide with the new CIS borders. It thus allows
Ukraine far more weapons than Russia (west of the Urals), but also splits it
in two, along the dividing line between the old Soviet military districts of
Kiev and Odessa.
Nato officials said yesterday they hoped to get away with only minor
technical adjustments to the treaty, which they said was 'the cornerstone'
of any further arms control, such as the troop reductions being discussed in
Vienna.
