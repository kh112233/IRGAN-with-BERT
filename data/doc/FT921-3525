FT  13 MAR 92 / Motor executives to meet government ministers on car
recycling
Driving a bargain: motor industry executives are to meet government
ministers next week to examine ways of recycling more effectively the 2m
cars scrapped annually in the UK, John Griffiths writes.
The meeting reflects increasing concern throughout the European Community on
the issue of car recycling. About 75 per cent of materials in scrapped cars
are currently reclaimed. German manufacturers such as Volkswagen already
have pilot plants in operation seeking to achieve a level of 90 per cent,
however. VW's advertising campaign for the new Golf - illustrated above -
stresses this potential.
At their meeting with Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, and
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, the executives will
consider methods of increasing the percentage of materials recoverable from
cars, reducing waste which has to be incinerated or dumped, and ensuring
scrap materials are not contaminated by hazardous oil and brake fluid.
The government is looking to the industry to come up with practical
processing solutions but ministers are ready to legislate to ensure that
scrapped cars are committed to approved recycling points.
Mr Lilley said yesterday that the DTI would provide a Pounds 300,000 grant
to help a four-company consortium establish ways of reusing plastic waste
from the car production process and scrapped cars. The consortium comprises
ICI Chemicals and Polymers, ICI Europe, Enimont, the Italian plastics group
and Fiat, the car manufacturer.
