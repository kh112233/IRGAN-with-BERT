FT  28 JUL 92 / Kuwait recovers airliners
KUWAIT yesterday recovered six airliners which Iraq seized when it invaded
the emirate in 1990 and flew to safety in Iran during the Gulf war, Reuter
reports from Kuwait.
The first, a Kuwait Airways Airbus A310, was flown home from Mashhad in
north-east Iran with Iraqi markings still partly visible. Iran, postponing a
claim of about Dollars 90m (Pounds 47m) for maintenance charges, turned the
other five aircraft over to Kuwaiti pilots and technicians in Mashhad who
plan to fly them out in the next few days.
