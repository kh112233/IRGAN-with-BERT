FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japan shies from east Europe trade
Japan's leading trading houses, discouraged by lower than expected
investments and business chances, are reviewing their operations in eastern
Europe.
Initially, its trading companies rushed to set up offices in the region,
following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the eastern bloc's
communist regimes. However, investment in the reconstruction of Europe by
Japanese companies has remained inactive, as Japan's economy has
deteriorated over the past two years.
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, was forced to closed its Tokyo
office last year, due to the reluctance of Japanese companies to invest in
former East German companies.
Mitsubishi, the largest trading house, closed down its representative office
in Bucharest last October, assigning its Vienna office to look after
business in Romania. Nissho Iwai, which currently has seven offices in east
European cities, said it would gradually reduce the number of its operations
during the year.
The traders' sluggish business has been caused by a fall in imports due to
the diminishing purchasing power of local governments as foreign currency
reserves have fallen.
'There are far less joint ventures with western countries than we initially
anticipated, and business conditions seemed to have worsened since there is
no aid from Russia,' said Nissho Iwai.
Meanwhile, Itochu said it was still seeing strong growth in Hungary and the
former Czechoslovakia.
However the company said it would have to start reviewing other East
European operations if the current economic environment in the region
continued.
