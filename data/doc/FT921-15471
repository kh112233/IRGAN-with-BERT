FT  10 JAN 92 / New move on Mexican air pollution
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has set up a commission to co-ordinate
Mexico City's fight against air pollution, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.
The commission, to be headed initially by Mr Manuel Camacho, the capital's
mayor, will include five cabinet ministers, the governor of the state of
Mexico, the director of Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, and local ecologists.
It will start with a budget of the equivalent of Dollars 165m (Pounds 91m),
half of which will be financed by the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
The new body has been created to avoid the inter-ministerial rivalry
hampering the design and implementation of the existing pollution programme,
costed at Dollars 4.6bn. Mr Camacho had been at odds with Mr Manuel
Bartlett, who recently vacated the education portfolio, over a possible
change of the school calendar. Pemex had fought unsuccessfully to keep
prices of unleaded petrol substantially above those of leaded petrol until
the oil company was able to meet demand through domestic production, rather
than imports.
Mr Salinas ordered the commission to draw up a plan in 30 days to outline
how all public vehicles and taxis could use natural gas. This would reduce
pollution levels but would probably increase Mexico's gas imports. Pemex has
not the capacity to meet expected demand.
