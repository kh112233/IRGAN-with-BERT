FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
It is a pity that Rolls-Royce's shares spend so much of their time below the
flotation price. Some decent capital appreciation through the biggest
aircraft order boom in history might have persuaded shareholders that they
were being rewarded for taking substantial risks. Instead they have the
wooden spoon of a reduced dividend barely covered by earnings - and that is
if one charitably excludes exceptional items.
Nor should investors have any illusions that yesterday's tough action is the
prelude to another great engineering recovery story. Consumers may be
perking up, but they are not going to buy fleets of 747s. Rather the risk is
of further order cancellations, and the market may not even bottom until
1994. The Pounds 50m provision against customer payments may not be the
last.
The company highlights its strong balance sheet, but small might be a more
illuminating description. Most of its competitors in jet engines and power
engineering are in much larger groups and some have even stronger balance
sheets. It is they, not Rolls, which have the muscle. The research costs and
market risks rest on a slender capital base. But then, 'twas ever thus.
