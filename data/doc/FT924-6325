FT  21 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: BES launches
THE WIND of change continued to blow through the Business Expansion Scheme
market this week.
Some very speedy investment decisions came in its wake.
On Monday, the British Linen Bank launched a series of BES companies which
would invest in assured tenancy rental accommodation. But, like schemes
launched in September by Johson Fry in association with TSB, and by Close
Brothers in association with Barclays, it came with a guarantee that a
non-recourse loan would be available after six months.
This loan facility proved so popular that the entire Pounds 15m offer had
been snapped up by Thursday - even though the scheme had had little chance
to gain any publicity.
Another scheme, without a non-recourse loan, also managed to sell out this
week.
The 'non-recourse' loan changes all the ground rules of BES investment. The
extensive tax advantages of owning BES shares are sacrificed if you dispose
of the shares within five years.
This made the investment somewhat inflexible and inappropriate for those who
needed their money sooner.
However, the Inland Revenue has decided that it will permit banks to lend
money to BES shareholders with only the value of the BES shares themselves
as security.
The lenders have no recourse to any other of the shareholders' funds apart
from the BES shares.
That means that the shareholders can effectively walk away from the
investment as soon as they have taken the loan.
The tax reliefs on offer make it possible to offer high returns - for
example, for every Pounds 1 invested, the British Linen Bank was offering
72p after six months.
Once tax relief of 40p in every Pounds 1 is taken into account, that means
that before expenses each investor has managed to convert 60p into 72p in
the space of six months.
None of this works for basic rate tax payers, who will have paid 75p after
tax for each share.
These schemes offer a heavy advantage to top-rate payers.
