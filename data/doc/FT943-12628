FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: What you should ask
Is your account paying the highest rate? Not many people would turn down the
chance of receiving Pounds 1,000 for doing almost nothing - but such a boost
is available to Lloyds customers who have deposited Pounds 50,000 in the
bank's 90-day notice account. If they switched their money to the equivalent
account offered by National Counties building society, they would earn an
extra 2 per cent interest a year. But if a smaller, less familiar
institution has no attraction, how about the Woolwich? Even this building
society would pay Pounds 800 more than its high street rival.
How safe is the institution? While higher rates don't always mean higher
risk, they often can. Be wary of unfamiliar names. Some investors may prefer
to avoid smaller institutions, especially banks where there is a greater
risk of failure and loss.
Can I get compensation? Yes, but it is limited. The Deposit Protection
Scheme for banks will cover only 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000  -
in other words, a maximum of Pounds 15,000.
The protection scheme for building societies will guarantee to repay 90 per
cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
One way round this could be to spread your money between different
institutions.
Instant access or notice account? Higher rates tend to be paid on accounts
requiring the longest notice but this is not always the case. See if you can
strike a balance to find a rate which is both very competitive but also
instant access. Postal accounts are a good start.
Keep a regular check. Once you have tracked down the right account, you will
need to keep an eye on it. Today's thoroughbreds have a nasty habit of
becoming tomorrow's also-rans.
