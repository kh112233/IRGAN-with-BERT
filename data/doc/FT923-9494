FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Attitude to Cadbury clarified
Sir, The article 'Cadbury proposals prove unpalatable' (August 3) contains a
reference to the Institutional Shareholders' Committee's position which
might give a misleading impression of the warmth with which the ISC welcomes
the draft Cadbury report.
At its June 17 meeting the ISC council agreed that a press release showing
the ISC's general support for the work of the Cadbury Committee should be
issued. However, it is important to understand that the ISC is an umbrella
body whose members are the associations representing the different groupings
of UK institutional investors - the insurance companies, the pension funds,
the unit trusts, the investment trusts and the asset management arms of the
merchant banks. Each ISC member felt this important subject deserved
detailed debate within its own membership, and separate responses have been
prepared and delivered to the Cadbury Committee.
In the circumstances the ISC's press release could not have been couched in
other than general terms. Its apparent failure in the eyes of your
commentator to provide a 'ringing endorsement' should not be taken to
indicate that the ISC is less than warm in its support.
E M Sandland,
chairman,
Institutional Shareholders' Committee,
