  [Abstract] The Danish Watch instrument aboard the Granat 
Observatory identified a new x-ray source on 7 August 1993. The 
flux from the source when it was first detected was 600 mCrab in 
an energy range of 8-20 keV. The instrument managed to localize 
the source to within about 1. The following coordinates for 
the 1950.0 epoch were recorded: _a_ = 
17[.sup]h[/]24[.sup]m[/], _b_ = 2043'. The radius of 
the region of localization with a level of significance of 1_s_ 
was 40 arc minutes. The source is in the Hercules constellation. 
The distance between GRS 1724+21 and the x-ray source closest to 
it (quasar V396 Her) is 4. The source "switched off" on 11 
August. The front of increasing intensity is considerably 
shorter than the period of decay of the light curve, and the 
light curve weakened from 7 August through 9 August. Figures 1,
