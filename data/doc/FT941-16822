FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: General director quits Czech
national airline
Mr Georges Veydovsky has resigned as general director of CSA, the Czech
national airline in which Air France, the Caisse des Depots and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have equal share in a 40 per
cent stake, the Czech news agency reported yesterday.
It said the resignation was accepted, though CSA or Air France would not
comment on the report last night.
Mr Jan Strasky, Czech transport minister, was also reported to have
confirmed the government would provide guarantees on Dollars 8.5m of
payments for aircraft leases due by mid-January.
Mr Veydovsky, who was Air France representative on the CSA management board,
is said to have offered his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in Prague
yesterday. The meeting was called to discuss restructuring plans for the
troubled Czech airline, which is expected to post losses of up to Kcs1.2bn
(Dollars 41m) for 1993.
Management board changes had been expected following the appointment of Mr
Antonin Jakubse as CSA president last month. He replaced Mr Jiri Fiker. Mr
Fiker was asked to resign by the Czech government, which still holds 49 per
cent of CSA's shares through the National Property Fund, an institution
established to oversee privatisations.
Mr Jakubse's appointment was one of several decisions taken at a
shareholders' meeting specially convened before Christmas to discuss CSA's
worsening financial position, and claims by Air France and the EBRD that the
company was overvalued when they bought their stakes in 1992.
That meeting agreed to implement a crisis restructuring plan to bring the
troubled Czech carrier back into profit within two to three years.
Mr Jakubse was charged with immediately preparing a 'crisis plan' for the
airline. Industry sources suggested this would include reducing the
workforce, and cutting back on unprofitable routes.
