FT  16 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor cool towards renewal of sanctions
law
MR Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is urging Congress to resurrect
the administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority without
tacking on to the legislation a renewal of Super 301, a provision much
despised by the country's trading partners.
Super 301 requires the trade representative to list 'unfair' trading
countries and negotiate away their trade barriers. It was used sparingly in
1989 and 1990 - against Japan, Brazil and India - and then it expired.
The deadlines imposed by Super 301 requiring action, or a waiver of action
on grounds of national interest, can reduce flexibility for trade officials.
They have said that the imposition of sanctions during key negotiations such
as the Uruguay Round could be highly damaging.
President Bill Clinton strongly endorsed a renewal of Super 301 during the
election campaign last year, and Mr Kantor has not retreated from that
position. However, his endorsement at a hearing on Monday was
unenthusiastic.
Although promising to 'work with' Congress on Super 301 at another time, he
was quick to imply that the administration was moving aggressively without
its help.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate international trade sub-committee
and a strong supporter of Super 301, told Mr Kantor he wished the
representative would 'more strongly embrace' the provision. Would it not
give him 'additional negotiating leverage' in the Uruguay Round?
