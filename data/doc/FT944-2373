FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Enchante
In the good old days, of course, spooks had no names at all. Even allowing
for the showier demeanour of the modern variety, however, there are those
who would consider the recent escapades of Guy Azais, number two in France's
leading spy agency, faintly outre.
For Azais, who works at the General Directorate for External Security, has
just multiplied himself. A commoner is reborn an aristocrat. Meet Guy Marie
Joseph Gerard Azais de la Garde de Chambonas.
The genuine aristocracy, needless to say, has no truck with such behaviour.
But commoners may legally adopt aristocratic handles that would otherwise
become extinct. The former president Valerie Giscard d'Estaing was only
so-named because his family went title-shopping in the 1920s.
But it didn't work. Almost everyone referred to him as VGE. So are you ready
GMJGAGC?
