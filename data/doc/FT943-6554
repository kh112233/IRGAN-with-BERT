FT  29 AUG 94 / Energy Savings Trust cuts list of proposed projects
The government-sponsored agency to promote energy efficiency has slashed its
list of proposed projects after failing to win the support of Ofgas and
Offer, the gas and electricity industry regulators, for more ambitious
plans.
Last May the Energy Savings Trust, which is central to the government's
strategy to conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions, said it needed to
raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets.
But according to Mr Eoin Lees, executive director, it is now 'just trying to
keep the show on the road'.
The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements which save energy,
passing on the costs through gas and electricity bills. But the only
substantial funding which it has secured so far has been approval from Offer
for electricity saving schemes costing Pounds 25m a year to 1997, and funded
by a Pounds 1-a-year levy on consumers.
The trust is awaiting a decision from Ofgas on a proposal for a similar
level of funding. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general, has opposed EST
projects because, she says, they require the regulator to impose taxes on
consumers.
Earlier this month Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry
regulator, decided against fresh measures to curb demand for energy. He
softened the blow to environmentalists by announcing financial incentives
for electricity companies to cut power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of
the electricity passing through the system.
The trust is unlikely to fare any better with Ofgas. Last month it asked
Ofgas to approve a levy which would raise Pounds 25m a year for five gas
conservation projects. The schemes, which the trust says are supported by
British Gas, would run until 1997.
Ms Spottiswoode is said to be 'giving serious consideration' to the
proposals. But she has repeatedly opposed on principal schemes which require
the regulator to tax consumers.
