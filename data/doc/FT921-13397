FT  22 JAN 92 / UK rebuffs Argentine military overtures
DISCREET attempts by Argentina to resume normal military ties with the UK
appear to have been rebuffed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the
Falklands war.
It emerged yesterday that the Ministry of Defence has turned down a request
from Argentina to allow a limited supply of UK-manufactured spare parts to
the Argentine navy, begun during the Gulf war, to continue.
Whitehall has also vetoed a plan for an Argentine military transport
aircraft to fly to Britain next month to collect some cargo assembled by the
naval attache's office at the Argentine embassy in London.
Argentine officials insist the cargo would have involved nothing more than a
few boxes filled with books and military research periodicals, as well as
brochures of British defence companies, normally sent via the diplomatic
bag.
But the planned trip by an aircraft which is normally used by the Argentine
navy to transport military equipment would have almost certainly fuelled
stiff opposition from the Falkland islanders and from MPs opposed to any
suggestion of a 'sell-out' over the islands.
Military ties between the two countries have been governed officially by an
arms embargo imposed by Britain on Argentina following the outbreak of the
Falklands war in 1982.
During the Gulf war, however, London agreed to the supply of Rolls-Royce
spare parts to the Argentine navy which operated with the allied forces.
The parts were for Argentina's German-built destroyer Almirante Brown, which
is powered by Rolls-Royce Olympus and Tyne gas turbines. They were drawn
from Royal Navy stocks.
Argentine officials had hoped the waiving of the arms embargo would pave the
way for a more open policy on military relations.
The Argentine navy is believed to be cutting the operational hours of
vessels to minimise the use of equipment for which replacement parts are
needed.
