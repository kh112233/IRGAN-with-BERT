FT  26 OCT 92 / Hungarians furious over damming
SLOVAKIA began damming the river Danube at the weekend to divert the river
into the controversial Gabcikovo hydroelectric barrage. The move prompted
furious diplomatic protests from neighbouring Hungary which is resisting the
project.
Slovak trucks began dumping rocks into the river after negotiations with
Hungary in Brussels last week under European Community auspices broke down
in acrimony.
Budapest reacted immediately by saying it was turning to the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and invoking the international
crisis procedures previously applied to the former Yugoslavia.
Hungary also fired off an appeal to the International Court of Justice in
The Hague even though Czechoslovakia has refused its jurisdiction.
Slovak and Hungarian negotiators will meet again next week as part of the
Visegrad central European group's talks with the EC, which are expected to
be overshadowed by the dam dispute.
Germany is understood to be exerting strong pressure on the Czechoslovak
government to exercise its authority over Slovakia while the country remains
united and to freeze construction work until there is a negotiated
settlement.
But Slovakia's decision to move ahead with the final stage of construction,
which will result in the diversion of the main flow of the Danube in the
next few days, makes agreement all but impossible.
