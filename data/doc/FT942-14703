FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Britannia's better second half
Britannia Group, the property developer and builder, returned to profits in
the second half of 1993, but still ended the year Pounds 503,000 in the red
pre-tax, against Pounds 393,000.
There was a surplus of Pounds 362,000 for the six months to December 31, but
there was a Pounds 750,000 charge for land provisions which left the
year-end deficit higher. Turnover expanded from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds
36.3m.
Directors explained that the group's strategy of focusing on housebuilding
and construction 'is beginning to bear fruit while our divestment from
commercial property has continued both during the year and into 1994'.
They said they expected to return to the dividend list in the current year.
