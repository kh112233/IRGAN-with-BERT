FT  22 OCT 92 / Start on N-waste dump planned
UK NIREX, the nuclear waste consortium, confirmed yesterday that it hopes to
start sinking access shafts in early 1994 for a rock laboratory on the site
near Sellafield, West Cumbria, it has chosen for Britain's first underground
nuclear waste repository.
Its public consultation document, launched yesterday, on the Rock
Characterisation Facility, says Nirex aims to complete the sinking of its
twin 650-metre shafts by mid 1996.
The document says a planning application for the repository could be made in
late 1996 or early 1997.
