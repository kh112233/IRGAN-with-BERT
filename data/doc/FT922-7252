FT  19 MAY 92 / Prague launches sell-off scheme
CZECHOSLOVAKIA yesterday launched its voucher privatisation programme as
Czechs and Slovaks began bidding for the future shares of over half the
country's enterprises.
The 8.5m citizens who earlier this year subscribed to the scheme by buying a
book of vouchers for a nominal sum will have until June 8 to choose the
enterprises in which they want to invest. They will receive their shares
later this year.
A total of Kcs292.6bn (Dollars 9.7bn) worth of equity, calculated on the
book value of some 3,000 enterprises, will be distributed.
The launch of the voucher scheme before next month's general elections is a
success for Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister and leader of the
most popular party in the Czech republic.
The launch was originally scheduled for February and Mr Klaus has waged a
battle with government officials to ensure that bidding would start before
the elections on June 5. His last-minute victory over bureaucratic delays
will allow him to flag the voucher scheme as a personal triumph during his
electoral campaign.
Dazzled by the sheer choice of enterprises, and often lacking basic
information about them, two thirds of the future shareholders have opted to
entrust their vouchers to private investment funds which will select
enterprises for them. Vouchers are expected to be converted into shares by
the autumn, once the selection process is completed.
The initial allocation of shares will be done in the two weeks following
June 8. But enterprises which are over-subscribed will be re-offered for
higher bids.
The process will be carried through five rounds which, government officials
say, will establish a 'valuation' mechanism in voucher terms for the shares.
