FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties battle over women
candidates - General election
LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats vied with each other yesterday over which
party would field the most women candidates at the general election.
Mrs Ray Michie, the only Liberal Democrat woman MP, announced that her party
would have 135 female candidates. At least three, apart from herself, are in
constituencies the party hopes to win.
However, with the main parties realising that the male domination of the
Commons is becoming unattractive to voters, Labour responded by releasing a
list of 134 female candidates.
Party officials hinted strongly that two or three more would be in place
before the election. Ms Jo Richardson, shadow minister for women, said
Labour would end up fielding most female candidates and was the only party
'that will put more women in the House of Commons - not only on the
backbenches but in the cabinet'.
The Conservatives have 61 female candidates. Of those, 16 are already MPs, a
few of whom are likely to lose their seats. But six others are candidates in
seats now held by male Tories and likely to be retained by the party.
The Liberal Democrat claims coincided with a Westminster rally of 70 of the
party's women candidates addressed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. He
said the votes of women may determine the outcome of the election.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats backed child care vouchers, which
could be used at private or state nurseries or at workplace creches, to
increase employment flexibility. The party's proposals for electoral reform
would mean more women in parliament.
Liberal Democrat womens' best chances at the election are in Rochdale, where
the Liberal Democrat MP is standing down, and the Tory marginals of Richmond
and Barnes, and Falmouth and Camborne.
