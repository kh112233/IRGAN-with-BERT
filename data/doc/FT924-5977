FT  24 NOV 92 / Legal Briefs: Punitive damages
The Court of Appeal's judgment last week in the Camelford Water Pollution
case marks the first major restatement of the English law on exemplary, or
punitive, damages for 20 years, according to City solicitors Herbert Smith.
Rejecting a claim for punitive damages by 180 people who suffered
side-effects from drinking contaminated water at Camelford, Cornwall in July
1988, the Appeal Court made it clear that punitive damages cannot be awarded
in claims of negligence, breach of statutory duty or public nuisance.
