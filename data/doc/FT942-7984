FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russia yet to follow Estonia's
example
Sir, Your editorial commentary 'Chernomyrdin sees the light' (May 18),
attempts to portray yet another Russian prime minister as an economic
reformer. You claim that Mr Chernomyrdin has taken to heart the experience
of 'the former Soviet Baltic states, especially Estonia'. This assertion is
incorrect.
Estonia's record on inflation and growth has surpassed other former Soviet
republics'. That is due, in large part, to Estonia replacing the rouble with
the kroon and introducing a currency board-like system on June 20 1992.
Under that system, the kroon is backed 100 per cent by foreign reserve
currencies and gold and is freely convertible at a fixed rate of eight
kroons per D-Mark. The Bank of Estonia cannot engage in discretionary
monetary and/or exchange rate policies. It cannot finance fiscal deficits.
Indeed, the bank's hands are tied, so that changes in the stock kroons are
automatically determined by the free flow of monetary reserves in and out of
the bank.
The Russians, including the so-called reformers, have always rejected what
has become the hallmark of Estonia's reforms, the currency board system. For
example, in 1991 most of the future Russian 'reformers' attended meetings in
Paris. It was there that the young turks selected Mr Yegor Gaidar to be
their leader. It was also there that they were introduced to the currency
board idea. Since then, Russians of all stripes have expended considerable
effort defending the institution of central banking for Russia and objecting
to the currency board alternative.
If Mr Chernomyrdin is ever to be serious about the goal of currency
stability, he must tie the hands of the Central Bank of Russia. To do this
he must do what Lithuania did on April 1, when it followed the Estonian
example.
