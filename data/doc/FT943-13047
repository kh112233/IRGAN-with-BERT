FT  21 JUL 94 / BT union rejects flexible hours deal
The main union in British Telecommunications has decided to recommend
rejection of a new package of flexible working hours which would mean many
more staff working in the evenings and on Saturdays.
The executive of the National Communications Union had been expected to take
a neutral stance after union officials negotiated a deal which ensured that
all changes would be voluntary.
But in spite of the misgivings of many officials the executive has decided
to recommend rejecting the changes in a consultative ballot after pressure
from some branches.
BT had said that it would withdraw an inducement of Pounds 1,000 for those
opting for weekend work and Pounds 400 for those who do early morning or
evening shifts if the union recommended rejection. But last night the
company said the offer was still on the table.
Separately, the three unions in BT yesterday issued an 'alternative
prospectus' to shareholders, arguing that the company is undermining morale
in the way it is trying to reduce staff numbers.
Mr Simon Petch, general secretary of the Society of Telecom Executives,
which represents BT managers, said that the unions wanted to help BT. But he
said that threatening many of the 32,000 managers with compulsory redundancy
was counter-productive as many would volunteer to go if their redundancy was
handled in the right way. BT has said that it wants 3,000 redundancies as
soon as possible from the 7,000 senior managers on personal contracts.
