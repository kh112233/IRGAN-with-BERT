FT  22 APR 93 / Bulls and bears examine the latest prescription: A look at
prospects for the new bioscience group as it presents its case
WHEN Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, extols his company's
virtues, he has more on his mind than just parental pride. There is little
doubt the flotation of his company, previously part of ICI, will go ahead.
But there is more of a question mark over the price institutional investors
are prepared to pay for the accompanying Pounds 1.3bn rights issue.
Zeneca's prospectus published yesterday contained enough to establish a case
for those bullish about the company. But it also contained plenty for the
bears.
The bulls' case - and that of the management - is summarised as follows.
Zeneca has been stifled in the past by being part of a large organisation
making anything from bulk plastics to vegetarian meat substitutes. Freed
from the dead hand of bureaucracy at ICI's Millbank headquarters, the group
will be able to join the ranks of successful pharmaceuticals groups such as
Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
The management also stresses the good prospects for Zeneca's three divisions
 -pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities.
In pharmaceuticals, Zeneca has already suffered the full brunt of the US
patent expiry of Tenormin, its best-selling product. The company has no
significant patents liable to expire in the medium-term. Management argues
Zeneca is as risk-free as a healthcare company can get.
Meanwhile, new products such as Zestril, an ace-inhibitor for hypertension,
the cancer product Zoladex and the anaesthetic Diprivan are growing fast.
The drugs pipeline, says Mr Barnes, is the group's most exciting ever in
terms of numbers and quality.
Zeneca's management argue the stock market has over-reacted to the dangers
of the forthcoming US health reforms.
Price increases may be regulated, but the reforms could include a package to
provide government-paid drugs for up to 75m people without insurance for
drugs. There might be a big expansion in market size.
Meanwhile, although the agrochemicals and seeds market is suffering,
operating profits should improve from cost-cutting. The performance of the
specialities division, which management agrees is unacceptable, can only
improve. The division also contains what Mr Barnes calls the wild card of
Quorn, the vegetarian meat substitute, which he claims could generate sales
of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 2bn.
SG Warburg, one of Zeneca's advisers, concludes that prospects are so bright
that group operating profits could increase from Pounds 587m last year to
Pounds 965m by the 1995. One final attraction is that the share price will
be underpinned by a higher than industry-average yield.
However, the bears also have some arguments on their side. Admittedly, bears
and bulls can agree the specialities division should benefit from the
pick-up in the US economy where about 42 per cent of business is located.
But the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals divisions face a rocky future.
The US drugs market, the world's largest, is changing rapidly. The change is
being driven by managed healthcare organisations, bulk buyers of healthcare
able to negotiate substantial discounts from drugs groups. SmithKline
Beecham reckons 40 per cent of its business is with the managed sector and
expects this to be 80 per cent by the year 2000.
The growing power of the managed sector has, for the first time, created
price competition in the US, particularly in therapeutic areas where Zeneca
is strongest. Price competition in the ace-inhibitor market, where Zestril,
Zeneca's fast-growing drug, competes, has been especially bitter.
The situation is set to deteriorate further. Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten,
one of Zestril's main competitors, loses its patents in 1995 when the whole
sector will be further undermined by generic competition. Although 20 per
cent of Zeneca's US drugs turnover is to the managed sector, only at the end
of last year did it set up a unit to deal with managed groups.
As for Zeneca's much-vaunted drugs pipeline, most R&amp;D directors outside the
company are dismissive of its prospects.
Merrem, an antibiotic tipped by SG Warburg as one of Zeneca's brightest
hopes, is entering a highly competitive and not particularly fast-growing
sector. Accolate, an asthma drug also highlighted by advisers, will have to
compete directly with a compound developed by SmithKline Beecham. Proving
the efficacy of Zeneca's schizophrenia drug, Seroquel, is likely to prove
tricky.
Meanwhile, the agrochemicals industry, in which Zeneca slipped from number
two to number three last year, is in turmoil. Ciba, the Swiss group and
world's number one agrochemicals company, estimates the EC market fell 10
per cent year after the announcement of the EC's common agricultural
reforms. It reckons there will be a further 10 per cent fall this year.
Zeneca believes the EC market, where it has 40 per cent of sales, will
decline this year, but not by as much as 10 per cent.
Mr Barnes sets off tomorrow for a month-long tour of European and US
institutions. Like all good salesmen, he knows he must convince his hearers
not just about the product he is selling, but also about his price.
