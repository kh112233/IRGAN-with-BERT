FT  26 MAY 93 / EC seeks observers at trial of Tibetans
THE European Community is likely to press China to allow it to have
observers present at the trial of Tibetan dissidents arrested around the
time of last week's visit by European diplomats to Tibet, European officials
said yesterday.
European pressure, and violence in Lhasa on Monday and yesterday, are
embarrassments which Beijing did not want while Washington debates the
conditions which it will attach early in June to China's most-favoured
nation trading status.
Police yesterday used tear gas for a second day running to disperse a group
of 100 to 200 Tibetans who gathered outside Jokhang Temple, a shrine in the
Tibetan capital. Many shops were closed and police patrols were heavy in
Lhasa .
Envoys from the 12 EC countries, now back in Beijing, are working on a
report about their week-long visit to observe the human rights situation,
during which they learned of the arrests of three named individuals. The
Danish ambassador, representing the EC presidency, sought to have observers
at their trial, and also requested access to them. He was refused.
According to European officials, the authorities at first said they had no
knowledge of the arrests, but later confirmed them.
Western countries believe independence of Tibet from China is unrealistic
but want Beijing to discuss the territory's future with Tibetans including
the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader.
Reuters newsagency quoted a police spokesman describing Monday's
demonstration of about 2,000 people as 'counter-revolutionary activity'.
'It began as a protest in the name of lowering prices for grain and oil, but
it changed its nature into a counter-revolutionary activity,' the police
officer said. 'The demonstrators plotted to attack government offices and
police stations and to beat policemen.'
