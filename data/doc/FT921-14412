FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Porsche cuts payout as income
falls 70%
PORSCHE, the German maker of luxury sports cars, has cut its dividend after
a steep slide in profits caused by recession-hit foreign markets and high
provisions for job cuts.
Group net income fell by 70 per cent to DM17m (Dollars 10.6m) from DM57m in
the year ended July 1991 and the dividend on the voting shares, owned by the
Porsche and Piech families, goes down to DM9 from DM12 a share. That on the
preference shares falls to DM10 from DM13.
Because of the provisions, Porsche finished with a much worse result than
expected. The company had warned that net profits would be around DM50m.
Mr Walter Gnauert, finance director, said the provisions totalled some
DM60m, including the cost of shedding 550 non-production workers. The
dollar's decline had reduced operating profits by DM66m, while model changes
had held back production. Earnings per share were down to DM23 from DM68.
Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive, said the weak state of some car markets meant
last year's sales and profit levels would not be achieved this year. 'This
is a difficult phase for Porsche,' he said.
Unit sales would drop further to around 25,000 in 1991-92 from 26,200. This
compares with 30,200 in 1989-90 and 50,000 in 1986-87, just before Porsche's
sales and profits collapsed as a result of the weak US market.
Last year, Porsche's performance in the US again deteriorated. Turnover
there was 26 per cent lower, compared with a 15 per cent decline in other
foreign markets. In Germany, however, sales jumped by 39 per cent. Group
turnover eased by 1 per cent to DM3.1bn, of which cars accounted for
DM2.4bn.
Mr Bohn said Porsche, which has been subject to intense takeover
speculation, could absorb the sales decline.
Mr Gnauert said Porsche had net liquid funds of DM620m. Cash flow was DM273m
against DM297m.
