LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS 
Three cheers for Rep. George W. Crockett (D-Mich.), columnist William F. 
Buckley, former Secretary of State George Schultz, U.S. District Judge Robert 
Sweet and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. While countless other public officials 
exploit the drug problem for personal political advantage, they have 
unselfishly championed the only rational, effective alternative to the 
currently disastrous situation: legalization. 
Supply does not create demand. Demand creates supply. We can spend any amount 
of money trying to intercept substances. We can impose any penalty on the 
dealers and users. We can completely erode the civil rights of our citizens. 
But as long as someone is willing to pay for a commodity, someone will be 
willing to supply that commodity; and the more risk the suppliers assume, the 
greater their profits will be. This is basic economics, simple human nature and 
can not be altered by legislation. 
What we can do is eliminate international drug lords, terrorism, corruption and 
criminal empires by taking the profit out of the equation. By shattering their 
market, we can literally shut down these drug mafias overnight. 
We can also redirect our efforts and resources toward diminishing the demand 
for drugs by accurately publicizing the health risks inherent to the user. 
Former Surgeon General Koop has demonstrated that the public can be positively 
influenced in terms of substance abuse. And he didn't require a $9 billion 
budget to do it. 
By initiating serious discussion of the decriminalization issue, Messrs. 
Crockett, Buckley, Schultz, Sweet and Schmoke have done far more to protect our 
youth from the drug problem than all the rest of the "drug warriors" combined.
