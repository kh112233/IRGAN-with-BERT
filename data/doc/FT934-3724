FT  08 DEC 93 / Transrapid rail venture set for the green light
The German government is set to give tentative approval today to the
revolutionary Transrapid magnetic hovertrain, intended to travel between
Hamburg and Berlin at 400km an hour.
New proposals submitted by the private-sector consortium backing the
project, involving Thyssen, Siemens and AEG, will increase private
participation and reduce the public sector risk exposure.
A final decision by the government on its backing for the project will be
taken only next year, according to Mr Matthias Wissmann, transport minister
and an enthusiastic supporter. By then it will have to meet with the
approval of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, who has criticised previous
proposals as too risky.
The plan to be presented to the cabinet today involves a private arrangement
to run the Transrapid operations, but public-sector financing for the rail
line. The new trains - nicknamed the 'whispering arrow' - are intended to
run every 10 minutes between the two cities and reduce the current 3 1/2
 hour journey time to just one hour. The aim is to begin construction in
1996 and start running test trains by 2003.
The operating company, in which Lufthansa and the future independent German
railways would have stakes, would have an equity capital of some DM1.5bn
(Pounds 586m) and raise loans amounting to some DM3.3bn without any
government guarantees. The line would cost DM8.2bn, including debt servicing
and inflation, the consortium estimates.
The project has widespread backing among politicians as a vital project to
confirm Germany's leadership in transport technology. Government and
opposition remain divided, however, on its economic viability. Mr Uwe Jens,
economic spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats, yesterday gave the
scheme his blessing for its contribution to research and development.
However, the party's transport spokesman, Mr Klaus Daubertshauser, warned
that it could be 'an incalculable financial risk'.
