Beales Hunter, the refrigeration and electrical components company, reported
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.24m for the year to May 31, bearing out the
profits warning made in June.

profit would not match the previous year's Pounds 2.3m. That figure was
restated in yesterday's results at Pounds 1.86m under FRS 3.
Group sales in the 12 months rose to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds 41.7m). Earnings
