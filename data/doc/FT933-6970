FT  25 AUG 93 / Hague court to hear genocide allegations
THE International Court of Justice in the Hague will consider today Bosnian
accusations that Serbs have been carrying out a campaign of territorial
expansion through 'ethnic cleansing' and genocide.
A similar application by the Bosnians four months ago resulted in a court
order to stop the genocide.
Legal officials in The Hague say a decision on the case is unlikely for
several days, not least because the court will simultaneously be considering
similar accusations from Serbia of genocide carried out by Moslems.
But though few expect the ruling to carry much weight with the forces on the
ground, the hearing is likely to fuel a wider diplomatic debate over
attempts to bring legal retribution to bear in Bosnia.
Next month the United Nations general assembly is expected to name 11 judges
who will sit on the UN war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, in a separate move, the International Red Cross (ICRC) has called
a conference in Geneva on August 30 to discuss the treatment of war victims.
The organisers claim the conference has been called to raise awareness of
the Geneva conventions, with participants expected from more than 100
countries.
But ironically, the ICRC's tradition of neutrality has left it refusing to
co-operate with UN investigators seeking evidence of war crimes.
With other European governments increasingly reluctant to dwell too much on
the issue - particularly when the west is pressing adoption of a peace plan
 -there are fears at the UN war crimes council, formed seven months ago to
collect information on war crimes, that attempts to build a case could
ultimately be undermined by a reluctance to submit evidence.
