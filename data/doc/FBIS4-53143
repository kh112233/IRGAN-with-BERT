  [Text] HANOI, May 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam has denied any 
territorial ambitions against Cambodia following claims by King 
Norodom Sihanouk that Hanoi was nibbling away at its neighbour 
by slowing moving border markers. 
  "Vietnam has never had ambitions for Cambodia's territory 
and 
always scrupulously implements all agreements signed on border 
and territories between the two countries," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. 
  In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review King 
Sihanouk accused Vietnam of "moving border markers deeper into 
our territory." 
  "Now the border markers are walking, they are walking 
towards 
the west... they know we cannot take care of two fronts 
simultaneously," the king said, describing the situation as 
"terrible." 
  Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer 
Rouge 
regime which had launched many attacks across the frontier. 
Hanoi pulled its troops out in 1989 ahead of the implementation 
of a peace plan and elections. 
  Phnom Penh has treated Hanoi's denials of territorial 
ambitions warily as over the last two centuries, Vietnam has 
pushed further into what was once Cambodian territory.
