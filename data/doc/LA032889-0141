P.M. BRIEFING; 
PANEL ON ALTERNATIVE FUELS FORMED 
Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, calling America's dependency on foreign oil 
"disgraceful and shocking," announced today the formation of a 27-member task 
force to study the use of alternative fuels for vehicles into the 1990s. 
The West Virginia Democrat was in Detroit to meet with the nation's top auto 
makers concerning the development of cars that run on fuels other than 
gasoline, such as methanol or natural gas. 
He also said such a program to develop alternative fuels would put unemployed 
farmers and coal miners back to work. 
The National Alternative Fuels Task Force will include representatives from 
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., the National Coal Assn., 
United Mine Workers of America and major oil companies.
