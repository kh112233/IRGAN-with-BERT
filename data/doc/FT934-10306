FT  05 NOV 93 / Refugees entering Germany on decline
THE number of asylum applicants seeking refuge in Germany last month
totalled 16,660, nearly the same as the previous month, but two-thirds lower
than the same period last year, the federal interior minister announced
yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The figures are expected to fall further in view of the new asylum law,
scrapping article 16 of the constitution giving asylum seekers an automatic
right to stay in Germany, which came into force in July. It also cut the
monthly living allowances to asylum seekers on Monday, from an average of
DM589 (Pounds 239.40) to DM440. There were further cuts in clothing and
medical funds.
Nearly half the refugees entering Germany last month came from the former
Yugoslavia, a trend which has continued unabated since the war erupted in
June 1991. Germany has provided refuge to over 460,000 inhabitants from the
region. Since January, over 72,000 refugees, including 18,200 from Bosnia,
have settled in the country.
Romanians account for the second largest group. Over 72,000 have entered
Germany since January, including 1,400 in October. Many of the refugees
belong to the Gypsy community, or are poor.
The interior ministry said these numbers were slowly decreasing largely
because amendments to the law meant border guards could send back
individuals if they entered from a third, safe country. The authorities have
decided on 41,000 cases, of which 4.4 per have been allowed to stay.
