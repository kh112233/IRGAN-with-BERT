STUDY FINDS FLUORIDE WORSENS BONE AILMENT 
Fluoride, the most widely used treatment for osteoporosis in the world, is not 
effective and increases the risk of fractures in women with the debilitating 
bone disorder, a four-year study released Wednesday said. 
The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that, 
although fluoride did increase bone mass, the new bone was structurally unsound 
and the treatment actually led to a threefold increase in the number of bone 
fractures.
