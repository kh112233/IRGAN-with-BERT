FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: GE, Skoda in power co-operation
General Electric of the US and Skoda, the Czech Republic's leading
industrial company, have announced a 10-year agreement of 'co-operation and
strategic association' in power generation projects.
The deal, signed at Plzen, is a coup for GE, which has negotiated the
agreement in the past few weeks in spite of long, intermittent talks between
the Czech company and Siemens of Germany.
Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, said Skoda
would be supplying mainly steam turbine components to GE.
The US company expects to place about Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m (Pounds
3.35m-Pounds 6.7m) in orders with Skoda in the next two years, with
commitments expected to increase after that.
GE will supply gas turbines and combined-cycle engineering for
Skoda-designed power plants in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the
Middle East and Vietnam.
Both companies have also agreed to explore opportunities for co-operation in
individual power plant construction projects elsewhere.
Skoda has been wooed by westerners since the opening of the old Comecon in
the early 1990s. GE had also talked with the company at that stage, said Mr
Pressman. Skoda reached agreement in principle on a broad co-operation in
power with Siemens in 1991.
Talks on a final agreement ended in November 1992 but they were resumed in
March last year, focussing only on turbine manufacturing.
A preliminary contract by Siemens and Skoda was signed in July but final
agreement has not been reached. Siemens said yesterday that talks continued,
but the implications of the GE deal remained to be seen.
Western companies have been keen to marry their strengths in gas turbines to
Skoda's expertise in steam turbines.
Skoda's low-cost manufacturing base has also been attractive.
