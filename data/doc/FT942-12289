FT  30 APR 94 / Stock swindler gets 12 1/2 years: International News Digest
Mr Eddie Antar, 46-year-old perpetrator of one of the biggest stockmarket
swindles in US corporate history, was yesterday sentenced by a federal court
in Newark, New Jersey, to 12 1/2 years in prison for racketeering,
conspiracy and fraud.
The founder and former chairman of the Crazy Eddie electronics store chain
was also ordered to repay Dollars 121m (Pounds 80m) to shareholders who lost
their money when the company went bankrupt. Mr Antar said he would appeal.
Mr Antar was convicted in July last year on 17 counts relating to the
swindle. The prosecution said he pocketed Dollars 75m by selling shares in
Crazie Eddie at a price artificially inflated by phoney statements he made
about the company's financial position.
Crazie Eddie grew in the 1980s from one family-owned store in Brooklyn to a
chain of 43 stores. After it went public in 1984 it became a stock market
flyer, but only because Mr Antar was fiddling the books to suggest that the
enterprise was booming. One manouevre involved flying out of the US with
company cash strapped to his body and re-cycling the funds as company
revenues to bamboozle Wall Street analysts.
The truth emerged after he lost control of the company to a dissident
shareholder group in 1987, but Mr Antar fled the country in 1990 while
facing federal contempt charges. He was only brought to justice after being
extradited from Israel at the end of a two-year manhunt.
