FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft issues new MS-DOS
after verdict
Microsoft has moved quickly to issue a new version of its widely used
personal computer operating system software, MS-DOS , following last week's
verdict in a Los Angeles court that the company is guilty of patent
infringement.
Last week, Microsoft was found to have infringed patents held by Stac
Electronics, a small California software company, and ordered to pay Dollars
120m in damages. The patents cover data compression technology used to
double the storage capacity of a personal computer hard disk.
Stac is seeking an injunction to halt Microsoft's sales of programs
containing the offending technology. These include MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2, the
operating system software that is normally installed in new PCs before they
are shipped from factories.
Microsoft said that it has begun sending English language copies of MS-DOS
with the data compression feature removed to 1,300 PC manufacturers
worldwide.
Other European language versions will follow within a few days.
Microsoft said that in light of the verdict it was also removing data
compression from several other products. Most users will not notice the
changes, the company said.
Stac has asked the court to force Microsoft to withdraw all offending
products shipped since February 1. This would include Microsoft software and
PCs pre-loaded with software that is currently on the shelves of computer
stores.
However, Microsoft said that it does not anticipate any 'material'
disruption of the supply of any of its products.
Microsoft continues to deny patent infringement and said that it will ask
the judge to overturn the jury verdict and, failing that, it will appeal.
