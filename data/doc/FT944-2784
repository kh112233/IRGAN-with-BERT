FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved beer sales volumes help Greene
King to Pounds 10.7m
Greene King yesterday announced its first improvement in beer sales volume
in three years as it reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 9.49m to Pounds 10.7m. Turnover rose from a restated Pounds
72.8m to Pounds 77.5m.
Most of the growth came from managed pubs, which sold 16 per cent more beer,
partly reflecting additional houses purchased from Bass. Their sales and
operating profits rose by 19 per cent. Volumes sold to the free trade and
national accounts dipped slightly, leaving overall volume up 0.2 per cent at
410,000 barrels.
The second half had started well with beer volumes and food and drink from
managed pubs showing further growth, said Mr Timothy Bridge, chief
executive. Consumer confidence remained fragile, however, particularly in
East Anglia, the group's home market.
Underlying profits growth was 8 per cent, excluding reorganisation costs of
Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 336,000) and a Pounds 763,000 gain on disposal of
investments, mostly the profit on the sale of the 29 per cent stake in
Morland, the Thames Valley brewer.
The Pounds 29m proceeds helped cut net debt from Pounds 100.6m to Pounds
69.2m and gearing from 43 per cent to 28 per cent.
Greene King continues to look for new pub sites in densely populated areas,
typically to the south and south-east of its home base. It hopes to open
about seven new pubs this year; so far it has opened one in Crawley and one
in Oxford.
The interim dividend is 4.1p, up 6.5 per cent. Earnings per share were 19p
(16.1p) before exceptionals and 17.2p (16.4p) after.
