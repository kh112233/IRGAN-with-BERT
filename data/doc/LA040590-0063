TACO BELL CITED FOR CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS 
A Taco Bell fast food restaurant in Mira Mesa has been cited for violations of 
child labor laws as part of a concentrated strike force crackdown last month by 
U.S. Department of Labor investigators. 
The citation was part of a nationwide crackdown from March 12 and 14 by the 
Labor Department that turned up 10,987 children said to be illegally employed. 
In California alone, the investigations of 218 employers turned up 880 alleged 
violations. 
The Mira Mesa Taco Bell violation, however, was the only one found in the San 
Diego area, according to the Labor Department. 
The Taco Bell at 8389 Mira Mesa Boulevard was cited for seven violations of 
regulations which stipulate that 14- and 15-year-old workers may not work more 
than 3 hours a day or later than 7 p.m. on school days. Children of that age 
are also prohibited from working during school hours. 
Workers in that age category are also barred from working more than 18 hours a 
week or from working more than eight hours a day on weekends when school is in 
session, said Robert Kelley, director of the Department of Labor's San Diego 
district office. 
The owner of the Taco Bell, Bob St. John of Escondido, was fined $1,260 as a 
result of the citations, according to the department's regional spokesman in 
San Francisco. St. John was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole said in a statement that cases of 
illegally employed children are on the rise and that the department has begun 
publicizing the names of violators in an effort to discourage child labor law 
abuses. The names of about 300 employers nationwide were released, including 
the local Taco Bell. 
Child labor laws also prohibit children from working certain kinds of jobs 
including manufacturing, meat processing, public messenger work or jobs that 
require the operation of motor vehicles, power machinery or tools.
