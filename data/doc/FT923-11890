FT  22 JUL 92 / Falklands picks groups for oil study
THE FALKLAND Islands government has chosen two companies for a multi-million
pound seismic study of territorially disputed waters in the South Atlantic
from October, confirming its decision to exclude Argentina from the initial
search for oil.
But in a move which could lessen potential conflict between London and
Buenos Aires over the issue, Falkland Islands officials have agreed to allow
results of the survey to be made available to oil companies operating in
Argentina.
The UK Foreign Office is expected soon to give its formal seal of approval
to the licensing arrangements between the islands' government and the two
companies, Spectrum of the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New
York-based energy services group Schlumberger.
Both companies were picked from a list of groups that had expressed an
interest to the British Geological Survey, the UK government-funded research
organisation which is advising island officials.
Under draft arrangements approved by the Falkland Islands government, the
companies will spend more than Pounds 7m on high-technology seismic work
expected to be completed by October 1993. Revenue from the results' sale
will be shared between the companies and the Falklands government. The work
will be carried out within a 200-mile zone around the islands.
Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the Falkland Islands government, said
the islands had a policy 'to do our own thing within our own waters'. But
the decision to make the work available commercially is in part a concession
to the Buenos Aires government.
