FT  21 AUG 92 / Czechs and Slovaks in agreement over split
LEADERS of the Czech and Slovak regional parliaments took a further step
towards the eventual liquidation of the Czechoslovak republic yesterday when
they agreed that both regions would become successor states to the present
federation, Reuter reports from Prague.
'We have agreed to that,' Mr Milan Uhde, chairman of the Czech National
Council, said after a meeting with his Slovak counterpart Mr Ivan Gasparovic
in Prague.
The two leaders discussed the work of commissions of the two assemblies
which are drawing up draft proposals for future co-operation after the
Czechoslovak state is dissolved.
Agreement on the break-up of the state has been one of the few points of
consensus between the winners of June's general elections in Czechoslovakia
 -the Civic Democratic party (ODS) in the Czech republic and the Slovak
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
ODS leader Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar of the HZDS have agreed that
both sides should conclude negotiations over the framework of future
co-operation between the two independent republics by the end of September.
The impending break-up of the country is the result of divergent views on
the future composition of the 74-year-old Czechoslovak republic.
Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar are due to meet in Prague on August 26 to discuss
further steps towards the split.
