WELL-SCHOOLED CLOTHES 
After a summer of neon-bright shorts and T-shirts festooned with cartoon 
characters, the freshest looks in children's fall fashion hark back to -- an 
unexpected surprise -- traditional styles. But not everything is regimentally 
striped and boringly home-grown. 
There's a definite international influence -- pants made of Guatemalan fabrics 
and shirts printed with designs from Italy -- but the comfortable fabrics, 
traditional patterns and classic shapes turning up in this fall's kids' clothes 
can only be called all-American. 
Like all-American kids themselves, these new looks break some very old fashion 
rules. Traditional patterns -- plaids, patchwork, nature prints, stars and 
stripes -- may be back, but adults should forget trying to combine them like 
old-school, mix-and-match outfits. Free expression reigns these days -- all 
manner of prints go together playfully. A classroom-ready palette of crayon 
reds, golds, greens, browns and blues replaces flashy neons and beachy brights. 
And denim is again a staple, from light blue chambray shirts to deep indigo 
jeans, jackets and overalls. Cotton, wool and blended knits appear in ribbed, 
twilled and quilted textures. To top it all off: Cozy sweaters bring out the 
child in everyone. BARBARA FOLEY
