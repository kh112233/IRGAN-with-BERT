FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Pulling strings
There are those who say that, without Denis Vaughan, Britain would not have
a lottery. Vaughan, an Australian-born orchestral conductor, would
presumably include himself in the list. He has been lobbying government for
years on the subject - but now it is up and running he reckons too much
lolly is going to the greedy operators, and that more of the profits should
be distributed to the arts.
So Vaughan has just submitted to the Treasury a modest invoice for his
services to date - Pounds 3,695,000. If Her Majesty's government coughs up -
not a racing certainty, it has to be said - the monies will be put to good
use in the guise of the Denis Vaughan Orchestral Trust Fund.
