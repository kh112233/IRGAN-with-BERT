FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alcoa forges Hungarian venture
THE Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
company, yesterday signed a joint venture with Hungalu, Hungary's
state-owned aluminium monopoly, in the first stage of a Dollars 165m
investment.
Alcoa has agreed to pay Dollars 50m to take a 50.1 per cent stake in Kofem,
a Hungalu subsidiary making flat-rolled aluminium products and extrusions in
Szekesfehervar, south-west of Budapest. The remaining stake will be held by
the Hungarian parent company.
The new venture, Alcoa-Kofem, will invest a further Dollars 115m over five
years in improving product quality and safety. Alcoa will provide technology
and expertise, and will share sales and market-ing responsibilities with
Hungalu.
The State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, and Hungalu, which
the SPA owns on behalf of the state, also took over two-thirds of Kofem's
debts of about Ft4bn (Dollars 51m) to sweeten the deal.
Alcoa's move is part of the group's emphasis on expansion in Europe, where
prospects for growth in aluminium demand are significantly more promising
than in the US.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chief executive of Alcoa, was bullish yesterday about the
east European region, hoping that the Szekesfehervar facility could become
'the premier plant in this part of the world.'
