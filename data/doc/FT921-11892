FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Miskin incurs Pounds 7.36m loss
Miskin Group, the USM-quoted contractor, property development, plant hire
and transport group, incurred losses of Pounds 7.36m pre-tax for the 18
months to July 31.
The results were qualified by Miskin's auditors on the basis that the
company was a going concern but that its future was dependent on successful
negotiations currently taking place with its bankers and principal
shareholders.
The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 559,000 for the 12 months to
January 31 1990, was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 4.62m for
property write-downs and interest charges of Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 158,000).
