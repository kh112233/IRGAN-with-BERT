FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A lesson for the self-righteous
Sir, Doesn't your editorial 'False moves in Malaysia' (February 28) confirm
that Kuala Lumpur's response was justified whatever the consequences?
The Malay government is reacting to the proposition that the British and
other Western governments are more civilised, have greater respect for human
rights and generally always know better. The contrast between the British
'free' press and the Malay press expresses the same idea: 'the wogs' do not
understand the subtleties of the democratic process.
It is quite ludicrous to imagine a 'free' British press. Does anyone recall
the coverage of the Gulf war, the grovelling before the Cook report, the
demonisation of the Serbs? The muzzle is in place; the difference is that
the leash is invisible.
At least the Malaysians have shown some self-respect, and taught the
self-righteous a lesson.
