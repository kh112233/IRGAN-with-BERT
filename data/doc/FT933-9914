FT  06 AUG 93 / Trans-Natal Coal's full-year income plunges
TRANS-NATAL Coal of South Africa yesterday warned that with no sign of a
major upturn in world spot prices for coal it did not expect to maintain
last year's after-tax income in the current financial year, Reuter reports
from Johannesburg.
'With no upturn in prices, there's going to a tough year ahead of us,' said
Mr Dave Murray, managing director.
In line with expectations, the country's biggest coal exporter maintained
the full-year dividend at 80 cents a share on a fall in per-share earnings
to 144.9 cents, from 180.2 cents previously, before an extraordinary cost of
R17m.
After-tax income fell to R115.5m (Dollars 34.4m) from R143.6m in the
previous year.
Mr Murray said that despite increased sales and cost controls, earnings were
still being hit by low spot and contract prices for steam coal exports,
particularly in Europe.
