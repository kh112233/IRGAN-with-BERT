FT  21 DEC 92 / Management: Go to work on some calcium - Health check
What do such diverse things as teeth, bones, oyster shells, chalk,
limestone, marble and pearls have in common? Calcium. This mineral is
essential in maintaining bone density, nerve transmission, heart beat
regulation, muscle contraction and blood clotting.
Moreover, researchers are finding increasingly important roles for calcium,
notably with regard to heart disease. More than 95 per cent of the body's
calcium is in the bones.
One's need for calcium increases steadily through adolesence. Between the
ages of 20 and 40, calcium increases bone density and thickness.
Osteoporosis, or 'porous bones', is a gradual loss of structural minerals
(decalcification) which begins in adulthood and progresses with age.
If you are worried about osteoporosis, consider these measures:
Take regular exercise. A 20-30 minute walk three times a week will help to
keep your bones strong and healthy.
Don't smoke.
Have only moderate alcohol and coffee consumption.
If you are a woman, discuss estrogen hormonal replacement with your doctor.
Increase daily calcium intake. Calcium-rich foods include low-fat skimmed
milk, yoghurt, cheeses, leafy greens, canned salmon, sardines with bones,
kale, broccoli and tofu.
Avoid aluminium-containing antacids.
Avoid eating excessive protein.
If you feel that you are unable to get enough calcium, either because of
insufficient intake or excessive loss - through drinking of alcohol and
coffee - you could consider calcium supplements. However, as extra calcium
intake can be associated with kidney stones, check with your doctor before
beginning such a regime.
