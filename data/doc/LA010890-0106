CONVICTED BROKER CHARGED IN TAX EVASION SCHEME 
A former vice president of a top Wall Street brokerage and 11 others were 
charged today with using money from an earlier fraud to organize a $1.1-million 
tax evasion scheme in upstate New York. 
Mark Stahl, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1987 for mail fraud at 
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and the others were charged with setting up 
companies that conspired to evade $1.1 million in state fuel taxes, said Nancy 
Connell, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. 
They were charged with enterprise corruption under an organized crime statute 
that carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail and fines. 
The alleged scheme involved several companies set up to deliver fuel to the Big 
Apple and Big M truck stops in the Albany suburb of Glenmont, Connell said. 
The defendants allegedly bought home heating oil and had it sold as diesel fuel 
at the truck stops, Connell said. Through this process, they avoided paying 
diesel fuel taxes, which are much higher than home heating oil taxes, she said. 
They were also accused of hiding from authorities the amount of diesel fuel 
they brought into the truck stops, evading still more taxes, she said. 
Stahl was convicted of transferring more than $1 million in Shearson funds to 
various bank accounts he controlled in 1986 and 1987. He admitted in court, 
however, to a much larger scheme involving more than $18 million.
