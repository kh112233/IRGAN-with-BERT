FT  05 AUG 92 / Food label changes proposed
THE government yesterday announced plans for tighter rules on food labelling
to require more information to be given to consumers and to curb misleading
claims by manufacturers.
However, Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, said implementation of most
of the planned changes would depend on negotiations in Brussels, where the
European Community is considering legislation on food labelling.
The measures were broadly welcomed by the Food and Drink Federation, the
main industry body, and by the Consumers' Association, which called them 'a
great leap forward'.
The proposed changes were recommended by the Food Advisory Committee,
ap-pointed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Among the
recommendations are:
Labels should carry descriptions of food products, as well as 'customary'
names. Meaningless descriptions should be banned.
More information should be given about perishable foods and about the
temperatures at which they should be stored.
Information about food additives and ingredients should be presented more
clearly, with uniform rules for the display of information required by law.
The government rejected a recommendation that health claims should be banned
unless they were backed by the government's chief medical officer.
