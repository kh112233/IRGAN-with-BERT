FT  17 JAN 92 / Iata official resigns over court case link
A TOP official of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has
resigned after being linked to a Washington court case, Reuter reports from
Geneva.
Iata said Dr Edward Spry had submitted his resignation as managing director
of the organisation - which with 204 members groups almost all the world's
airlines - on Monday after only three months in the post.
'We have learnt of the involvement of this official of Iata in a court case
in Washington DC and we are investigating,' the spokesman, Mr John Brindley,
said. 'Dr Spry has resigned from his position.' Dr Spry, a Briton who had
worked for Iata for nearly 20 years, could not immediately be contacted for
comment.
An economist, he took up the post in November following his appointment last
May on the retirement - after eight years - of his predecessor, Mr Neil
Gleeson.
As managing director, he was number two in the Geneva-based organisation and
was responsible for its day-to-day internal administration, reporting to Mr
Gunter Eser, director-general.
The Washington court case was a civil suit brought by Airline Economics, an
aviation consulting firm, against its former president, Mr Harold Pareti,
alleging misappropriation of funds and other acts.
A report in the Washington-based Travel Weekly on January 6 quoted papers
filed in the US district court by Mr Pareti as denying the allegations and
accusing the firm's principals of lying to him about its finances.
The weekly also said Mr Pareti accused them of paying what he called
unlawful kickbacks.
