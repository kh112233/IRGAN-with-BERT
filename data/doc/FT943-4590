FT  08 SEP 94 / Black market 'undermines CFC campaign'
A 'black market' in chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) is slowing the transition to
environmentally friendly substitutes, an Imperial Chemical Industries
executive said yesterday.
Mr Michael Harris, external relations manager of Klea, the ICI business that
makes CFC substitutes, told a British Association press conference in
Loughborough that illegal CFCs were flooding into Europe. As a result, CFCs
would continue to affect the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere
for longer than scientists had predicted. A ban on CFC manufacturing takes
effect in the European Union at the end of this year and in the rest of the
world at the end of 1995.
Dr Joe Farman, who discovered the seasonal 'ozone hole', told the meeting
that 70 per cent of ozone was lost over the Antarctic between August and
October last year. This year's hole 'is developing strongly', he said. 'It's
looking similar to last year.'
Mr Harris estimated that thousands of tonnes of CFCs were reaching western
Europe illegally. He could not say where they were manufactured, though it
is believed that eastern Europe or Asia are likely sources.
'The big high-profile users have switched to CFC substitutes, not only for
public-relations reasons but also because they want to be up with the new
technology,' Mr Harris said.
The black market relies on large numbers of small CFC users who do not want
to make changes in their equipment to use the substitute chemicals. CFCs
still cost only half as much as the substitutes.
Mr Harris blamed governments for 'losing interest in the ozone issue just at
the time when we need the most draconian monitoring and enforcement to make
sure that we really are getting rid of CFCs'.
He said all the technology and manufacturing capacity was in place to
provide safe substitutes for all CFC applications without causing any
disruption to industry.
