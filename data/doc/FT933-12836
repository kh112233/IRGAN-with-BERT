FT  22 JUL 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at work
The relationship with software suppliers is complicated. While Hoskyns
markets Data 3 in the UK, it does not have the rights in France. When
updates are released to ECIA plants in France, the French supplier has no
interest in helping Hoskyns - a direct competitor - to maintain the UK
version. HPC has the choice of missing updates or taking them in French. Its
choice of the latter must delight the parent company which encourages
workers to study foreign languages.
Making parts to order, rather than having long production runs has demanded
greater flexibility of Hill's staff. While McGilvray expected resistance,
the workers actually value the variety. This is in line with the predictions
of job design experts who suggest job satisfaction can be improved by
increasing variety and autonomy.
Underlying this is an implicit trust in the workforce. Twenty years ago,
wildcat strikes would have made the whole thing impossible. No manager would
have risked holding only a few hours' stock.
'Just in time' is an effective technique but a finely balanced one. Traffic
delays could bring production to a halt.
HPC keeps a five-day buffer of foam via a transport company. The foam
belongs to the manufacturer and does not appear on HPC's balance sheet. HPC
pays a small premium to hold the reservoir nearby. Such 'off-balance sheet'
stockholding must be a business opportunity for other intermediaries.
McGilvray has brought may changes to HPC, which has affected the bottom line
 -turnover and profit have increased dramatically. This is the acid test for
any system.
Lessons from this study:
Effective use of IT can transform production capability.
Just-in-time merely pushes your stockholding problem on to someone else.
Opportunities may be created for intermediaries to hold buffer stocks as
off-balance sheet items.
