FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (4): Loyalty to the label that reflects you
 -The autumn season is likely to be diverse but underlying themes still
emerge / A look ahead to autumn
For the fashionably correct the label as status has been replaced by the
label as statement. In typical 1990s mode, the designers you pick next
autumn will reveal less about your bank balance than your personality.
This season the new trends are fudged, so the creators of fashion have
produced collections that concentrate, often in extreme form, on their
individual beliefs as designers.
Your loyalty will be to the label that best reflects your own fashion
ideals. If you love Comme des Garcons' cerebral folding, you may well
despise Versace's raunchy brashness. If you enjoy Lacroix's flamboyant
fabric mixes, Armani's cool minimalism may do nothing for you.
Even in such a diverse season underlying themes emerge, however hidden by
the designers' handwriting.
The spring collections' juvenilia proved to be the shock troops in a general
movement towards a light femininity younger in spirit than in reality.
For autumn skirts are indeed short, hems flippy and waists high. But these
components can as easily make clothes for women as for girls.
Tailoring, meanwhile, takes a tomboy turn, with long, slender drape jackets
and skinny trousers worn coltishly with high heels.
Bulkier clothes return, but always with a light touch. This started as fuzzy
little mohair sweaters warming up spring chiffon layers; for autumn it
blossoms into anything from risible shaggy gorilla-suit fake fur to wearable
soft sheepskin.
It is then a short step in designer minds to padding in all its forms -
Winter Olympics ski jackets, quilted dressing gowns, kimonos and Tibetan
wrap coats.
Vivienne Westwood's bustles may have been overstating the obvious but it
seems, thankfully, as if next winter it will be cherchez la femme rather
than la petite fille.
