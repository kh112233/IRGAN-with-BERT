FT  01 JUL 92 / Wider inquiry on BCCI demanded
LAWYERS representing creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday called for a full public inquiry into what happened to the bank's
assets and who was responsible for the fraud that led to its closure last
year.
Speaking in front of the Luxembourg court, Mr James Lingard of Norton Rose,
the UK law firm that advises creditors' committees in London and Luxembourg,
said inquiries had been too limited. 'What we want to find out is who is
responsible and where the money went,' he said.
His call was part of an attempt to persuade the Luxembourg court not to
consent to a proposal agreed by BCCI's liquidators and the government of Abu
Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder.
The proposed settlement - likely to be in the region of between Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 629m) and Dollars 1.7bn - has already been approved by courts
in the UK and in the Cayman Islands but cannot take effect until Luxembourg
has approved it.
Touche Ross, liquidators to BCCI, said yesterday any remaining creditors who
has not yet done so should notify the firm of claims against the bank, even
though the official deadline expired yesterday.
