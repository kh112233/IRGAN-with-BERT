FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bargain hunting helps
Nikkei recover in light trade
THE Nikkei average, which fell sharply last Friday on news that Olympia &amp;
York had filed for insolvency protection in North America, rebounded on the
more phlegmatic reaction on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index regained 368.83 to 18,443.10 on bargain hunting, and short-term
buying of speculative favourites, after opening at the day's low of
18,128.16 and reaching 18,458.05 in the afternoon. Volume, however, fell to
220m shares from 352m as most institutional investors remained on the
sidelines.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said leading investors are likely to
remain inactive during the corporate results season, which commences this
week and is expected to last until mid-June.
Advances led declines by 668 to 324, with 144 issues unchanged, while the
Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 21.92 to 1,370.74. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.66 to 1,095.75.
Short-term trading by dealers lifted speculative stocks. Japan Metals and
Chemicals, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y85 to Y810 on the
'environmental theme'. The company makes metallic alloys used in batteries.
Okamoto Industries added Y80 at Y1,520 as dealers tried to revive the
'biotechnology theme'. Mitsubishi Kakoki, which makes industrial waste water
treatment equipment, rose by its daily limit of Y100 to Y1,080.
Banks, which fell sharply last week on the O &amp; Y developments, were bought.
Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y50 to Y1,790 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y80
to Y1,330.
Real estate issues, which lost ground last Friday on fears about real estate
lending, failed to recover. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading real estate
developer which announced its first fall in pre-tax profits in 16 years,
dipped Y20 to Y1,040. Aoki lost Y23 to Y512 on reports of its links to the
stock and bribery scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery
company.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 236.96 to 21,032.27 in volume of 11.8m
shares.

HKDollars 3.1bn.
