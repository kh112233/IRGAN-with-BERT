FT  15 JAN 93 / Disaster ferry had capsized twice before
THE POLISH ferry which capsized in a fierce storm off Germany's Baltic coast
yesterday - with the loss of 54 of the 63 people on board - had capsized on
two previous occasions, Reuter reports from Stralsund, Germany.
The Jan Heweliusz, built in 1977 and run by the privatised Polish company,
Euroafrica, was sailing from Ystad in Sweden to the Polish port of
Swinoujscie when in it turned over in heavy seas and winds of up to 100 mph.
German police said bodies were still being recovered and there were six
survivors among the 28 crew and 32 passengers, who were mainly truck
drivers.
Poland has set up a committee of inquiry. Officials suggested that the storm
may have caused one or more of 10 railway wagons on board to break free from
couplings.
The Jan Heweliusz had capsized on two previous occasions, in August 1982,
while loading at Ystad, and four years earlier, because of a fault in valves
regulating the ballast tanks. The ferry was the same type as the Herald of
Free Enterprise which capsized off Zeebrugge in March 1987, with the loss of
189 lives.
