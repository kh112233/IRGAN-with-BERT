FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian tin prices highest
for 19 weeks
TIN PRICES signalled a recovery in the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market yesterday to
close at MDollars 15.45 (Pounds 3.28) a kilogram, up by 42 Malaysian cents
from the previous day.
Yesterday's closing spot price, from a turnover of 87 tonnes, is the highest
reached in the past 19 weeks when prices hovered mostly below MDollars 15 a
kilogram.
On the London Metal Exchange, cash tin advanced by Dollars 227.50 (Pounds
134.3) to Dollars 5,915 a tonne at the close yesterday after rising by
Dollars 137.50 a tonne on Wednesday.
The market's rally, which has been evident through the week, offers hope of
relief to Malaysian companies where annual results released in recent days
have reflected the widespread industrial gloom and the numerous
announcements to move away from mining.
Malaysia Mining Corporation, the largest which annually produces 11,000
tonnes, slightly over a third of national production, reported its
first-ever operating losses in its tin operations last year.
Another company, Gopeng, with production of 1,600 tonnes, reported that
average metal prices last year fell by 29 per cent to MDollars 16,467 a
tonne, or MDollars 16.47 a kilogram.
Statistics, available to the end of last year, indicate that Malaysian
stocks have fallen by a third to about 14,000 tonnes, compared with more
than 17,000 tonnes currently held in the London Metal Exchange.
If the market rally continues, the Association of Tin Producing Countries
could again defer Thailand's proposal to impose further export cuts when it
meets in June. The proposal was rejected during the previous meeting held
early last month.
