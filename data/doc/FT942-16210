FT  12 APR 94 / Inquiry announced into toll motorway
A public inquiry into plans for the Birmingham northern relief road, which
would be the first privately financed toll motorway, was announced
yesterday.
The government will face stiff opposition from environmental groups when the
inquiry opens in Walsall on June 21. There have been objections from more
than 7,000 people and organisations against the 27-mile route which is
designed to relieve pressure on the M6.
The inquiry, to be held before independent inspector Sir John Fitzpatrick,
could take up to nine months.
The proposed road would be built and operated by Midland Expressway, a
company that has been formed by Trafalgar House, the shipping and hotels
group, and Grouppo IRI of Italy.
It would provide a link around the north-east side of the west Midlands
conurbation from the M6, north of junction 11, to the M6 east of junction 4.
Mr Roger Higman, transport campaigner of the environmental group Friends of
the Earth, said: 'We will be opposing this scheme very, very strongly at the
inquiry.' The road would not solve M6 traffic problems, he added.
Friends of the Earth say the road would lead to further development on
green-belt land and would pass through two sites of special scientific
interest, the River Blythe and Chasewater Heath.
