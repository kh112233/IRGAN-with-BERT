FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Cigarettes up 10p
Duty on tobacco products rose by 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes, 12p on a
25 gram pack of hand-rolling tobacco, 5p on a packet of five small cigars,
and 6p on a 25 gram pack of pipe tobacco. The changes took effect at 6pm
yesterday.
The estimated net revenue yield is Pounds 15m in 1995-96 on an indexed and
non-indexed base. The existing commitment to 3 per cent real increases
(already announced, and therefore not scored as additional revenue) is worth
Pounds 240m on an indexed base and Pounds 375m on a non-indexed base.
