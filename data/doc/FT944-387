FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing but a legal charade?
Sir, Are all share support operations to be made legal by the Appeal Court?
Perhaps the Guinness trial defendants will create an interesting legal
precedent ('Court review of Guinness case', December 23).
Will it be possible to argue that, for example, motorway motorists driving
at 120 miles per hour cannot be prosecuted because those driving at 75 miles
per hour escape?
Surely there is no question of innocence, otherwise the board of Guinness
would not subsequently have settled with Argyll? Is what remains, therefore,
simply another legal charade?
