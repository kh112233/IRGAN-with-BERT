FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs told of pressure by regulator
on British Gas
BRITISH GAS is supplying gas to four more gas-fired power stations than it
wanted to because it was forced to by Ofgas, the industry regulator, MPs
heard yesterday.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, told the Commons trade and industry
committee that Sir James MacKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, had
encouraged the 'dash for gas' by forcing BG to sell gas to generators
according to fixed schedules.
British Gas had demanded the right to negotiate freely on prices so that it
could control the amount of gas it contracted to supply.
British Gas signed its first Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant contract in
1990, but when further orders were slow to arrive it reduced its prices to
secure a second contract. Early in 1991 it experienced a surge in demand for
generation, so that demand temporarily outstripped the projected
availability of supplies.
Mr Evans told MPs that when British Gas raised prices to try to discourage
generators and restore the supply/demand balance, Ofgas forced it to lower
prices and sell more gas than it wanted to.
Britsh Gas is contracted to supply nine generating projects. But Mr Evans
said it was providing only 30 per cent of the total volume of gas going to
the generating market, with the remainder coming from competing suppliers.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, told the
committee a temporary transport subsidy of Pounds 512m over five years would
allow British Coal to sell 20m tonnes of coal into the European Community.
This would save all 30,000 miners' jobs under threat.
In other evidence, the Trades Union Congress called for an energy commission
to oversee an integrated energy strategy, including representatives from
consumer groups and unions.
