FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Electric-powered transport potentially cleanest
Sir, Mr Chilton's statement that electric vehicles are inefficient (Letters,
November 27) is incorrect, because the vehicle drive system itself is
intrinsically the most efficient and cleanest for road transport.
What is true is that our present power generation is dirty and inefficient,
but this is changing. Many of us have been working to develop an advanced
power source called a 'Fuel Cell', which instead of burning fuels, converts
them electrochemically, cleanly, quietly and efficiently.
We already have, in Japan and some European countries, fuel cell
power-generating plants with efficiency more than 80 per cent and minimal
pollutants. Fuel cells are also being evaluated for transport use, where
they are expected to be at least twice as efficient in overall energy use as
their internal combustion engined counterparts, while causing, according to
the US Department of Energy, only 1 per cent of the pollution.
The fuel cell is a proven technology, first developed in the UK by British
scientists, and it has the potential to make electric transport the most
clean and efficient of all possible in the near future.
