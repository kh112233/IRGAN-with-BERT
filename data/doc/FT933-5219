FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reuters to take extra shares
Reuters Holdings, the international news and information group, is intending
to buy a further 9.46 per cent of the shares offered above the 5.84 per cent
it originally sought under its Pounds 350m share buy-back offer.
Anyone tendering up to 5.84 per cent of their holding will have them
accepted in full. Of any excess 9.46 per cent will be accepted.
An error by one investor accepting for 11m shares rather than the intended
1m lay behind a revision in the acceptance figures for the offer.
The group yesterday said that acceptances had been received for shares
representing 36.19 per cent of its equity against the 38.65 per cent
previously announced.
The offer is being made as a way of returning its cash mountain - Pounds
710m at the end of 1992 - to shareholders.
