FT  26 OCT 92 / Shaken sales staff slip up on job
THE IMAGE of hard-pressed salespeople fighting to fend off the recession by
working all hours and driving 'unbeatable' bargains is comprehensively
debunked by research published today.
Hard times are just as likely to mean that sales people lose confidence,
fear increasing rejection by their customers and harbour low expectations.
The picture of despondency and self-doubt is painted by Sales and Marketing
Solutions, a York-based consultancy that has monitored the activity of sales
teams in a dozen companies active across the UK during the recession.
According to the consultancy, instead of clocking up extra mileage in search
of a sale, the salesperson is quite likely to stay at home or to fill the
day doing anything but closing deals.
'The recession, therefore, becomes self-fulfilling,' says Mr Frank Atkinson,
senior partner in the consultancy. The company reports that a recent study
of one nationwide group showed a sales force only half as active in pursuing
deals as it had been in more buoyant periods.
'When times are good you can, to a large extent, get away with trusting your
salespeople to bring home the orders, but when times are bad, companies
cannot afford such a laissez-faire attitude.'
The company's research also suggests that during a recession, product prices
might be driven down by those responsible for selling, rather than by canny
customers.
According to Mr Atkinson: 'The buyer asks if the price can be reduced and
the sales person responds by trimming the price rather than defending the
company pricing structure.'
The report says the failure to negotiate effectively is driving down prices
and reducing UK profits unnecessarily.
