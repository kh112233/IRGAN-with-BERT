FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey suggests big oil zone near Falkland Islands
Early findings from seismic surveys conducted this year in the south
Atlantic around the Falkland Islands suggest a possibility of finding oil
across a zone 25 per cent larger than the British North Sea.
The British Geological Survey, which advises the island's government, said
its reading of preliminary data from the two surveys suggested the region
had a good potential for finding oil. Confirmation, however, would require
exploratory drilling.
Mr Nigel Fannin, principal geologist in the survey's petroleum geology
group, based in Edinburgh, said the data suggested a sedimentary basin of
potential oil-bearing rocks of 200,000 sq km around the island, compared
with 160,000 sq km of such formations in the British North Sea. 'We have
been very encouraged by what we have seen,' he added.
The two seismic surveys concentrated on areas to the south, west and the
north of the islands, where the water is shallower than to the east.
Mr Fannin said the rocks and geological formations both appeared similar to
those of the North Sea. Other conditions would also be similar: the water
was 500 metres deep or less, and the sea state and weather would be similar
to that experienced in the northern zones of the North Sea.
However, Britain's Foreign Office played down the significance of the
findings. It said full seismic data would only become available next year
and many further steps would be needed before it was known whether
commercial quantities of oil existed.
Mr Fannin said the data should be complete by early next year, and the
survey expected to be in a position to advise the island government on
licensing for exploratory drilling by next summer.
A licensing regime has yet to be established and remains a sensitive issue,
with the sovereignty of the islands still disputed between Britain and
Argentina. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has kept open the
possibility of co-operation on oil exploration.
