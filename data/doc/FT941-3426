FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi back to black with Pounds 19m
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m for the year ended December 31
1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 595.1m in 1992, writes Diane Summers.
The figure was in line with City expectations, which were revised downwards
by about Pounds 6m in December, after a profits warning from the group. The
shares closed down 1p at 141p.
Saatchi hailed the results as a return to profitability for the first time
since 1988. However, the 1992 figure included a Pounds 600m write-off of
goodwill associated with US acquisitions made in the 1980s.
Revenue from continuing operations rose 10 per cent, from Pounds 731m to
Pounds 806m, but the rise was accounted for by currency movements, said
Saatchi. Excluding these, revenue for 1993 was flat.
Similarly, operating costs appeared to rise from Pounds 713.8m to Pounds
776.6m. But once constant exchange rates were applied and severance,
property credits and disposals excluded, costs dropped by 1 per cent.
The group warned that revenues in 1994 will be lower than for 1993. 'The
revenue outlook for 1994 is difficult. We have lost two big clients, in
neither case due to the quality of our work, and clients remain cautious
about their planned level of expenditure, particularly in Europe.'
Trading profits increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 34.2m).
Severance costs of Pounds 19.1m were charged and Pounds 7.3m surplus
property provisions were credited. Excluding currency movements and
exceptionals trading profits increased by 1 per cent.
Profit margins, excluding exceptional items, increased from 6.1 per cent to
6.3 per cent in 1993. Mr Charlie Scott, group chief executive, admitted that
the group was not on course to meet his target of 10 per cent margins by
1995. Meeting the target was dependent on revenues increasing in line with
inflation, and that had not happened during 1993, he said.
Profit attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 7.3m (loss of Pounds
613.7m), with earnings per share of 3.7p (losses of 362.8p). No dividend
will be paid.
After taking into account a Pounds 73m rights issue in June and currency
movements, average net debt during December 1993 was Pounds 112m, a
reduction of Pounds 82m. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds
30m for 1994, with earnings per share of 7p.
