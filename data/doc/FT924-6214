FT  23 NOV 92 / Audit law remit may be reduced
THE GOVERNMENT is considering the abolition of the requirement for small
limited companies to have an annual audit.
The Department of Trade and Industry is soon to issue a consultative
document which is likely to recommend dropping audits at least for companies
with turnover below the VAT registration threshold of Pounds 36,600.
The move would be one of the most radical changes since compulsory annual
audits for all limited-liability companies were introduced in 1900. It would
reduce costs for at least 250,000 of the 1.1m limited-liability companies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said: 'As the deregulation
minister, I am very keen that we should get rid of requirements which serve
little purpose. For the smallest companies we do have some scope for some
liberalisation.'
The move follows substantial lobbying for reform by parts of the accountancy
profession and from small-business organisations.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants is against abolition of
small-company audits, arguing that they help to ensure accuracy of financial
information and accompany the privileges of incorporation. The Inland
Revenue and several banks have also expressed reluctance to see the audit
abolished.
