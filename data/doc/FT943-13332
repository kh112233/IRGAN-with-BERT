FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions burden of big salary rises
Sir, Your report about utility bosses ('It's better when you're private',
July 16) makes little mention of the most disquieting of all the effects of
directors' sudden huge pay rises; the impact these can have on 'final'
salary pensions.
Taking into account the probable expense of indexing and of surviving spouse
benefits, as a simple rule of thumb it should be assumed that the true
capital cost of a pension will be 10 times the final pay. So if a chairman's
salary was Pounds 60,000 four years ago, but is now Pounds 240,000, the
contingent burden on the fund will have rocketed from Pounds 600,000 to a
staggering Pounds 2.4m, dwarfing any stock option windfalls.
The individual's own contributions, say 5 per cent of annual pay, will not
go far towards this. The balance of cost must be found from shareholders,
and to a massive extent by taxpayers in general via funds' exemptions. The
later the age at which pay rises are granted and the greater these are, the
larger the amount and the greater the proportion of pension cost must be
paid for by other people - many of whom will not belong to an employer's
scheme and never benefit from their enormous subsidies.
Public accountability for the inequitable redistribution these schemes
encourage scarcely exists, but the sudden extra earmarkings of funds to pay
for late awarded windfalls can to no small extent be offset by taking a
sharp axe to middle management.
The maths of final schemes are such that, if turned into early leavers ten
years or more short of normal retiring age, those paid less than Pounds
25,000 (85 per cent of taxpayers never earn more) get such poor pensions
that their costs are likely to be sustainable wholly on the fruits of their
contributions.
