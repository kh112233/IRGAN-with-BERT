FT  27 SEP 94 / Strike halts Portuguese trains
Portugal's international and high-speed inter-city trains were halted
yesterday as railworkers walked out on a five-day strike over working
conditions. All rail transport between Portugal and Spain will be cancelled
for the week, as well as high-speed service between Portuguese cities, the
state rail company CP said. There are no alternative arrangements.
Inter-city travellers will be rerouted to the regional lines, in many cases
doubling the travel time. The walkout is the third in two months by CP
workers, who are demanding their work week be reduced from 42.5 to 40 hours
and their contract conditions be improved. Some 270 trains scheduled for the
week - including 80 international trains - have been cancelled because of
the strike.
