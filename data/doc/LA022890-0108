COVENANT HOUSE FOUNDER RESIGNS OVER SEX MISCONDUCT CONTROVERSY 
The priest who founded Covenant House, the nation's largest organization for 
runaway youths, resigned Tuesday after months of disputing allegations of 
sexual misconduct. 
"The controversy that has surrounded me for the past three months has made it 
impossible for me to lead Covenant House effectively," Father Bruce Ritter said 
in a statement. 
Frank Macchiarola, a former city schools chancellor who served as acting 
president while the allegations were investigated, also resigned. 
Macchiarola, who was named acting president on Feb. 7, said he was quitting 
because the shelter's board of directors had voted against his proposals for 
the future of Covenant House. 
A spokeswoman for Macchiarola said he was not available for interviews but said 
Macchiarola had wanted to conduct reviews, investigations and audits of current 
practices and make changes. 
James J. Harnett, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will 
take over the shelter until a permanent successor to Ritter is found, the 
organization announced. 
In an interview, Harnett said he expected an international search for a 
successor to the Franciscan priest to take months and be limited to Roman 
Catholic nuns, brothers and priests.
