FT  25 FEB 93 / Questions of history and health for steel: The heat from the
political furnace
SINCE Europe's major steel producers appealed to the European Commission for
help in the autumn, events have shown how steel, a commodity product in a
declining market, still retains its role as a political hot potato.
But, as European Community industry ministers meet today in Brussels to
discuss a rescue plan, some may well ask how the industry got into such a
mess.
The problems are well known - overcapacity fed by past subsidies, recession,
and east European imports in relatively small quantities but at low prices.
But how much overcapacity is there and where? And, if politics was put to
one side, which steel plants should be closed or merged? Here are some the
key questions:
How much overcapacity is there?
As calculated by the EC the industry's 'maximum production potential' last
year was 192.6m tonnes. But that includes at least 30m tons of mothballed or
moribund plant, and the effective capacity is 155m-160m tonnes. Production
last year was about 132m tonnes of crude steel, of which 110m-115m tonnes
goes to the European market.
What should the industry's capacity be?
Overall, says Mr Philip Tomlinson of the London-based Commodities Research
Unit, a realistic target for capacity utilisation would be 85-90 per cent.
That leaves some leeway if market conditions pick up. Taking the peak output
of 138m tonnes in 1989 as the maximum that the industry would ever need,
that would mean a cut of around 15m-20m tonnes in effective capacity.
Why are cuts necessary?
To prevent the industry from going bust. Producers cut output by 15 per cent
in the fourth quarter of last year but that is only part of the solution.
The steel industry, says Mr Peter Fish of the Sheffield-based MEPS Europe
consultancy, needs both to cut supply and capacity. In the flat products
sector in particular, where integrated plants are best operated
continuously, they cannot be profitable unless they run at 80-85 per cent
capacity. Says Mr Tomlinson: 'Plants need to be shut down for the industry
to make money. You can't tackle the issue just by getting plants to produce
at a lower level. In a commodity business it's flat out or stop.'
Where is the overcapacity?
Everywhere - in the production of hot steel itself, in hot rolling mill
capacity and in the main product sectors, long products and flat products.
The largest overcapacity, says Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley, is in
coated or galvanised steel used for car bodies, but demand is expected to
rise in the next three to four years.
In crude steel production and long products, overcapacity is linked to
changing technology. The biggest surplus, says Mr Hadas, is in the hot metal
phase, and while 5m-6m tons of capacity are being closed down, the situation
will worsen as mini-mills - small, flexible mills that make steel from scrap
 -enter the market.
In long products, Europe already has several mini-mills, particularly for
the production of concrete reinforcing rods known as rebars. Other long
products, notably heavy sections and beams, are still made by integrated
producers - in relatively few mills, but with excessive capacity.
Which plants should close?
Many of the worst-performing plants were swept away in the last recession.
In the unlikely event that efficiency, rather than politics, is the
criterion for cuts, a worst-case scenario closure list could be:
Spain - the entire industry except long product mini-mills
Italy - Ilva's grossly-overmanned integrated steel works at Taranto, unless
Mr Hayao Nakamura, the steel group's new managing director, can turn it
round quickly
Belgium - Cockerill-Sambre's melting capacity, described by one observer as
'structurally hopeless'. Its finishing facilities could be linked with the
melting side capacity of Sidmar, majority-owned by Arbed, to create a new
force in flat products
Germany - Klockner-Werke is operating under court protection from creditors,
and Krupp-Hoesch is warning that it might get out of steelmaking altogether.
In efficiency terms, the real problem is Ekostahl, the largest eastern
German producer. Based at Eisenhuttenstadt (iron smelter town) its closure
would be 'political dynamite,' says one analyst.
What is happening in the market place?
The fourth-quarter production cuts were followed up with price increases in
January. Flat product producers are optimistic they can make the increases
stick, although so little business is being done that it is too early to be
confident, says MEPS Europe.
But the long products sector has been transformed by huge Chinese purchases
and increased demand from the Far East.
'The Chinese are buying a lot of rebar, and the mini-mills have cut back
output to to go on to lower electricity tariffs,' says Mr Tomlinson.
Along with spiralling scrap prices, says MEPS Europe, this has enabled
European producers to achieve 'quite spectacular' price rises in their
domestic markets. Overall, however, there are few signs of any pick-up in
European demand.
What is likely to happen at today's meeting in Brussels?
There will be no formal decisions. Instead, industry ministers are expected
to give their political backing to the Commission's outline plan for
commercial and financial support of EC steelmakers. They will welcome the
prospect of voluntary closures, organised by the industry - partly because
they would prefer not to take the tough political decisions on capacity cuts
themselves.
Industry has already suggested cuts of up to 25.8m tonnes in crude steel,
and 17.9m tonnes in rolled products, but the Commission will consult again
with steel producers over the next two months to see if further capacity
cuts are possible. Brussels says the industry should be aiming to cut 30m
tonnes of crude steel capacity and 20m in rolled products.
Diplomats say today's meeting is merely the 'first phase' of the political
process. Indeed, the important decisions may not be made until October, when
ministers will have to decide whether the industry's closure plans go far
enough.
