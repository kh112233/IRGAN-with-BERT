FAD WATCH; 
A VOTE FOR ABE 
Yes, we love Kermit and Miss Piggy, and have a special place in our hearts for 
Gonzo. But when that tall figure of Abraham Lincoln stands up to speak in a 
Disneyland auditorium, and a deep and dignified voice begins to resonate, well, 
it's practically goose-bump time for some people. 
"The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the 
American people, just now, are much in the want of one," the robot says, 
quoting one of five speeches given by President Lincoln between 1838 and 1864. 
"We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the 
same thing." 
Since it was moved to Disneyland from the 1964 New York World's Fair, the 
Lincoln exhibit has been one of the park's most enduring attractions. Millions 
of park visitors have listened to Lincoln's five-minute address, given 51 times 
a day. 
It's not as popular as other exhibits, but it's a sentimental favorite. That's 
why many people were upset at reports that Disneyland was thinking of removing 
the exhibit to make room for the Muppets. 
Thankfully, Disneyland insists that talk of removing Mr. Lincoln from the 
park's Main Street home is decidedly premature. "We have not made a decision on 
Mr. Lincoln vis-a-vis the Muppets," a spokesman said. 
That's good. 
Not even the Muppets are an adequate reason to remove this stirring exhibit. It 
is a useful way to put people in touch with American history. Now, as in 
Lincoln's time, we need something to remind us to keep searching for a good 
definition of liberty.
