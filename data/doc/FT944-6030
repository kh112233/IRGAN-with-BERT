FT  01 DEC 94 / 1,000 rescued from cruise ship
Two US Navy helicopters took food, water and medicines to nearly 1,000
passengers and crew rescued from the burning Italian cruise liner Achille
Lauro off the east coast of Africa, a Navy spokesman said yesterday. The
anti-submarine helicopter from the cruiser Gettysburg lowered the supplies
to the Panamanian tanker Hawaiian King and the Liberian bulk oil carrier
Bardu, which had picked up the survivors from life rafts earlier in the day.
All 979 passengers and crew had been accounted for, according to Italian
coastguard officers co-ordinating the rescue. The Naples-based owner of the
23,478-tonne vessel said two men, a German and a Briton, had died in the
below-decks blaze and eight people had been injured.
The Achille Lauro was insured for Pounds 11.5m with about half the cover
provided by the London insurance market, Lloyd's of London said. The vessel
made international headlines when it was hijacked by Palestinian guerrillas
in the Mediterranean nine years ago.
