FT  10 SEP 92 / Hungary tries to halt dam project
HUNGARY is making a last attempt to stop Slovakia diverting the river Danube
into an environmentally controversial barrage along their common border.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday persuaded Mr
Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, to set up joint commissions to head
off confrontation over the Bos-Gabcikovo hydroelectric project.
The timetable for agreement is tight because construction is approaching the
point of no return. Slovakia plans in mid-October to force much of the flow
of Europe's largest river into a 25km channel elevated up to 18 metres above
the surrounding plain and bigger than the Suez canal.
The Hungarian prime minister said in unequivocal terms yesterday that
Hungary would consider the diversion of the river a 'territorial violation'
and an infringement of the post-war peace settlement.
Despite the agreement on further talks, yesterday's meeting between the
prime ministers in Budapest left the two sides as far apart as ever.
The Hungarian government can ill-afford to give in for domestic political
reasons. The democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was born
out of hostility to the communist-inspired dam. Slovakia, on the other hand,
remains adamant it cannot afford to halt project. The Bratislava government
says the work is too far gone and 20bn korunas (Dollars 746m) has already
been spent on the dam, which will supply 10 per cent of the country's energy
needs.
Bilateral relations, already poisoned by the intractable dispute over the
Gabcikovo barrage, are troubled further by disagreement over the status of
the 800,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia.
