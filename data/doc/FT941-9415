FT  15 FEB 94 / Personal View: Positive aspects of Ireland's economy
European Union statistics shows that there is one member state whose growth
over the past five years is spectacularly ahead of all the others - almost
three times faster than the rest of the EU - and which has by far the best
EU record in relation to the expansion of manufacturing employment. It also
has the lowest rate of inflation during this period. Moreover, it has for
some years had the lowest level of public borrowing and by far the fastest
export growth and biggest external payments surplus in the European Union.
This state is also unusual in that the increase in the purchasing power of
its average wage since 1988 has been matched only by one other EU country -
Portugal. Other striking features are that it has the lowest death rate in
the world for mothers and for children under five, the highest level of food
consumption and the second-highest rate of home ownership. Its rate of
female participation in parliament and government is a third higher than in
Britain and the EU respectively.
The state in question is Ireland.
Of course, this is not the whole story. There are two other aspects of the
Irish state which are equally notable and less positive: its average level
of living standards, measured in terms of its disposable income per head of
population, is 22 per cent below that of the EU as a whole, and its
unemployment rate is higher than in any other EU country except Spain.
Both of these features are, however, largely time-lagged consequences of a
very high birth rate, which as recently as the late 1970s was as much as
four-fifths higher than in many other European countries. However, this
exceptionally high rate is now a thing of the past. For, despite the
increase of more than half in the number of young people in its population
during the past two decades, a virtual halving of the fertility rate has
reduced the Irish birth rate by more than a third. This was brought about by
the almost universal adoption of contraceptive practices, in disregard of
the attitude of the Roman Catholic authorities. It is quite possible that
within a few years the rate will have fallen to the kind of very low level
that prevails in countries in southern Europe.
Why has the Irish birth rate been such a crucial factor influencing
ultimately a country's living standards as internationally measured? For the
simple reason that a country whose birth rate has been very high in the
recent past is bound to have a much higher ratio of dependants to workers:
not only children and students, but also, eventually, unemployed. This is
because there is a limit to any modern industrial state's ability to absorb
very large flows of young people emerging annually from the education
system. This is why the Irish state's dependency ratio is 215 per 100
workers as against about 130 dependents per 100 workers in the UK and 157
per 100 in the EU as a whole.
Vis a vis the UK, this factor helps explain the Irish state's lower level of
output per capita. For after a five-year period in which Irish gross
domestic product has risen by 26 per cent, against a net 2 per cent in the
UK, the level of disposable income per worker in Ireland measured at
purchasing power parities is now the same as that of Britain and higher than
that of Scandinavia.
The level of Irish unemployment is also largely a function of the past high
birth rate. Because Ireland's population was a fifth smaller up to 30 years
ago, the number of annual retirements is currently relatively low. At the
same time, the high birth rate up to the 1980s has been yielding - and will
continue to yield until after 1998 - a high rate of entry into the Irish
labour force. The result: a need for a net annual increase of more than 3
per cent in jobs - whereas in the EU as a whole the rate has been only a
fifth of 1 per cent. With annual births down from 74,000 in 1980 to fewer
than 52,000 in 1989, and now dropping below 50,000, it is clear that this
problem will have largely solved itself within about 15 years.
Meanwhile, the short-term growth prospects of the Irish economy are probably
better even than forecast by the European Commission. There are now marked
signs of a recovery in consumer demand, which will generate increased
employment later this year.
This is the background to the recent Irish budget, which should have a
moderately stimulating effect on the economy, mainly through income tax
reliefs.
