FT  03 APR 92 / Argentines reflect on invasion
ARGENTINA yesterday commemorated the 10th anniversary of its invasion of the
Falkland Islands with a series of public events which, although low-key,
carried political tension.
President Carlos Menem cancelled plans to attend a military parade,
apparently for fear of being jeered by pro-military right wingers. He chose
to attend Mass at the national shrine of Lujan. However, former combatants
invited to join the president boycotted the service, claiming he was using
it for political purposes.
The bishop officiating at Mass said the invasion was to 'safeguard
constitutional order.' Mr Menem said: 'Today is a day of reflection and
homage to all those who fell defending national territory.'
The only military parade was held in the Patagonian city of Ro Gallegos,
2,100 km south of Buenos Aires and on the same latitude as Port Stanley, the
Falklands capital. There, Mr Antonio Gonzalez, defence minister, said
Argentina would eventually win sovereignty over the islands through
'tireless diplomatic efforts.'
Meanwhile, the UK embassy in Buenos Aires denied that the islands'
government would issue seismic survey licences for oil exploration, as
announced by the chief executive of the Falklands government this week.
'The British government is committed to giving no surprises and intends to
stick to this,' an official said.
The islands have legislation enabling them to market exploration licences,
but rules are still being studied in London and will only be enacted after
consultation with Argentina.
