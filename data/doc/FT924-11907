FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Aeroports de Paris more than
doubles first-half net
AEROPORTS de Paris, which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, has
recovered from the disruption caused by the Gulf War and more than doubled
net profits in the first half of the year.
During the first half of last year the Paris airports, like those in other
capitals, were badly hit by the dramatic decline in air travel for the
duration of the war.
However, the market has since recovered and, despite the economic slowdown,
which has had a strong effect on business travel, Aeroports de Paris managed
to increase net profits by 138 per cent to FFr215.1m (Dollars 42m) in the
first six months of 1992.
The number of passengers using its airports rose by 5.1 per cent overall
compared with 1990, the year before the Gulf War. However, this reflects a
sharp increase of 9.7 per cent in international passenger traffic and a
decline of 2 per cent in the domestic market.
Paris is one of the few European capital cities to have experienced an
increase in international tourism this year, partly because of the opening
of the EuroDisneyland theme park in April.
Aeroports de Paris saw turnover rise by 17.2 per cent from FFr2.37bn to
FFr2.78bn in the interim period while operating profits shot up by 50 per
cent from FFr330.8m to FFr495.5m.
