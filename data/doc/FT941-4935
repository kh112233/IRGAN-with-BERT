FT  09 MAR 94 / Domestic holidays lose out to foreign trips
The British went on a record 56m holidays last year but the proportion taken
in the UK fell to its lowest level ever, the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday.
British residents took 32.5m holidays of four nights or more in the UK last
year, 1.6 per cent up on 1992. But the number of foreign holidays increased
by 8 per cent to 23.5m. The share of holidays taken in the UK was 58 per
cent, compared with 60 per cent in 1992.
The number of domestic holidays taken rose from 31.5m in 1960 to more than
40m in the mid-1970s, before falling to 28.5m in 1987.
Over the same period there has been a sharp increase in the number of
holidays taken abroad. In 1960, only 3.5m Britons took their holidays
abroad. By 1980 the number had reached 12m.
While more Britons go abroad, a record number of foreign tourists have
visited the UK. The Central Statistical Office said last week that the
number of overseas visits to the UK rose 4 per cent to 19.3m last year.
However, the increase in the number of Britons going abroad resulted in a
rise in the travel account deficit of the balance of payments to Pounds
3.7bn last year, compared with Pounds 3.4bn in 1992.
Ms Adele Biss, BTA chairman, said yesterday: 'Our tourism industry cannot
survive on growth from overseas visitors alone. Nor can we expect cut-throat
competition from package holidays to disappear.'
She added that the UK tourist industry needed 'more focus on quality
standards, value for money, more energetic promotion and better marketing.
This is not by any means an impossible task. But we need greater commitment
from government and the industry, working in partnership, to arrest this
decline.'
