FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Liability climbs the ladder
Sir, The weight of professional negligence claims against auditors has
finally proved too much for the Institute of Chartered Accountants
('Auditors seek to limit liability', March 3).
It certainly is unfair that in the event of company failure auditors face
the prospect of almost unlimited liability, while shareholders enjoy limited
liability and the directors appear to have hardly any liability at all.
However, in order to protect innocent creditors who may be the victims of
professional negligence, any reduction in the degree of the auditors'
liability would need to be offset by a commensurate increase in the
liabilities of the directors. This would best be achieved by the
introduction of compulsory professional indemnity insurance for all company
directors.
