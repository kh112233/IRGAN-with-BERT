FT  23 JUL 93 / Unemployment to remain problem in Cleveland beyond 2000
UNEMPLOYMENT will remain a significant problem in Cleveland beyond the year
2000, with much of the small amount of anticipated economic growth
concentrated in sectors increasingly reliant on part-time jobs, Chris Tighe
writes.
That is the view of a report considered by county councillors yesterday. It
suggests a further decline in manufacturing employment, and says sustained
economic recovery will reach the area only if it can attract substantial
inward investment.
The research, carried out by council officers and based on 1991 census data,
estimates that the 'jobs gap' - the difference between labour supply and
employment levels - will decrease from 38,800 to 32,400.
