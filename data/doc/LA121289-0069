CONTRACT AWARDED FOR NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL 
The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded a $550-million contract to UE&amp;C 
Catalytic Inc. of Philadelphia to construct a facility that solidifies liquid 
nuclear waste. 
The waste vitrification plant will be built at the DOE's Hanford Reservation, a 
560-square-mile nuclear facility near Richland, Wash. It is scheduled to begin 
operating by the year 2000. 
UE&amp;C spokeswoman Nancy Pigford said the plant is designed to turn 
high-level liquid nuclear waste into a glass-like substance for shipment to 
deep underground burial sites.
