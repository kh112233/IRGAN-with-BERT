FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on bogus green products
MR David Maclean, minister for the environment, reaffirmed in the Commons
yesterday that the government intends to seek new powers to penalise
companies who make bogus environmental claims for their products.
He said urgent consideration was being given to changing the Trade
Descriptions Act, and the necessary legislation would be introduced as soon
as the parliamentary timetable permitted.
