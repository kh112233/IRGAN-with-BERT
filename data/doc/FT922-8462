FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar organisation cuts
estimate of surplus output
THE INTERNATIONAL Sugar Organistion's secretariat has cut its estimate of
the world sugar surplus in 1991-92 (October/September) to 510,000 tonnes,
raw value, from a previous projection of 1.4m tonnes, reports Reuter.
Production is seen totalling only 112.20m tonnes, compared with the previous
estimate of 112.84m tonnes while the consumption estimate has been lifted to
111.69m tonnes from 111.44m tonnes.
Estimates for Cuba, South Africa and Zimbabwe were all reduced sharply to
6.85m, 2.20m and 90,000 tonnes respectively, from 7.3m, 2.4m and 390,000
tonnes.
The ISO said the Cuban estimate reflected export indications and the
country's declared intention to harvest 'every last tonne of sugar'.
'Although this is higher than other analysts we feel it is too early to
reduce it further when the crop is still in progress,' the secretariat said.
Cuban figures received by the ISO showed exports between November and
January totalled 994,700 tonnes, up from 976,700 tonnes in the same period
the previous year.
Shipments to Japan rose to 159,900 tonnes from 64,600 while Portugal's rose
from nothing to received 66,400 tonnes. Cuban exports to the CIS fell to
286,200 tonnes from 464,200 tonnes.
