FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ICI sells Teesside plant
Imperial Chemical Industries confirmed yesterday that it is to sell its
ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to Union Carbide, the US chemicals
group.
Under the Pounds 40m deal, Union Carbide will acquire and operate ICI's
ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production plant at Wilton, on Teesside.
The 90 employees will transfer to Union Carbide.
The deal, signed early yesterday, is subject to review by the Office of Fair
Trading, but is expected to be completed within three months.
ICI was keen to stress the differences between this latest divestment and
its 1993 swap deal with Du Pont. Du Pont has since angered the Teesside
community, and embarrassed ICI, by announcing heavy job losses at the nylon
plants which it acquired there.
Mr Arthur Dicken, ICI's Teesside operations manager, said: 'There are two
big differences, the mutual dependence to supply each other and the very
firm plans to invest.'
Under the agreement ICI will supply Union Carbide with ethylene for the
Wilton site, and buy 45 per cent of its output of ethylene oxide, a key raw
material for a number of its businesses.
The two companies have agreed to fund jointly the expansion of the ethylene
oxide unit at Wilton from 240,000 tonnes a year capacity to 300,000 tonnes.
Union Carbide also intends to increase Wilton's ethylene glycol capacity
from 85,000 to 200,000 tonnes a year and may expand other facilities.
Mr Mike Brider, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said the unions would seek assurances that Union Carbide
would maintain union recognition and ICI employment terms and conditions.
