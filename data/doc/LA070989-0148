LEAD PAINT DUST; 
RENOVATIONS STIR UP NEW POISON FEAR 
Fleeing the suburbs to be nearer their jobs, young professional couples are 
buying and proudly restoring old houses and, in the process, inadvertently 
poisoning their young children with dust from lead paint. 
Recent studies have found that even low levels of lead may impair children's 
intelligence and learning potential, forcing public health authorities to 
reevaluate their estimates of the number of children at risk and to reconsider 
the level at which intervention should be required. 
"There have been many sleepless nights feeling guilty about what we might have 
done to our children, just because we didn't know," said Allen Gibson, 32, a 
Charleston, S.C., attorney whose young son was poisoned during the remodeling 
of their century-old home. 
Because the effects of low-level, asymptomatic poisoning are subtle, the 
Gibsons probably will never know whether their children have lost any 
intellectual potential. "I know you're not supposed to get really wrapped up 
with the IQ level of your child," said Allen's wife, Wendy Gibson, 28, a 
homemaker. "But if any numbers have been knocked off our children's IQ, we'll 
never forgive ourselves." 
The main culprit in poisonings is paint in older homes, especially those built 
before the 1950s. The poor are disproportionately affected because they tend to 
live in the oldest housing. But members of the middle class are not immune and, 
with gentrification, more and more are falling victim. 
In Millions of Homes 
Like asbestos, lead paint can be found in millions of homes built before 1977, 
when the Consumer Products Safety Commission restricted the metal in household 
paint for sale. In a report to Congress last year, the federal Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry estimated that about 12 million American 
children live in housing that contains lead paint at potentially toxic levels, 
and about 3 million to 4 million may have hazardous levels of the metal in 
their blood. 
"Lead poisoning these days is the most common preventable disease in the 
pediatric age group," said Dr. John Rosen, a professor of pediatrics at Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine in New York. "It's a national disgrace." 
Lead from any source is harmful to children, whether from food contaminated by 
lead-soldered cans or improperly glazed dishes, water by lead in pipes and 
solder, or soil and dust by freeways or industry. However, lead paint continues 
to be the major single source of poisoning in the United States. (Although 
pencils are made of graphite, not lead, they may be a source of poisoning if 
they are covered with lead paint.) 
A child can be poisoned by lead-tainted dust emitted from a painted surface 
that is cracked, water-damaged or peeling, even when the top layers are regular 
oil or latex paint. Even intact, uncovered lead paint can poison a susceptible 
child because it chalks and contaminates household dust. A baby teething on a 
door or windowsill, where lead paint was most often used, is also vulnerable, 
although most severe poisonings still occur from chronically eating paint 
chips. The higher the lead content, the sweeter they taste. 
Stripping old paint can be nearly as perilous as removing asbestos. Sanding, 
scraping or burning it with a heat gun raises a fine, invisible dust or vapor 
that can be extremely toxic. Lead particles are distributed into the 
environment, coating the floors, walls, furniture and children's toys with an 
invisible poison. 
Although the phase-out of lead in gasoline in the early 1970s is generally 
credited with reducing the average level of lead in the general population, it 
did not end the hazard. In the last three to five years, there have been 
ominous signs from around the world that even this progress has been 
insufficient. Careful epidemiological investigations have reported the same 
unsettling conclusion: lead in young children, even at levels thought to be 
safe, appears to cause long-lasting if not permanent damage in cognitive 
ability. 
Children More Susceptible 
Adults can get lead poisoning, but children are more susceptible because of 
differences in metabolism and excretion of the metal. Adults absorb about 10% 
of the lead they ingest; children absorb about 50%. Women of childbearing age 
are also considered of special concern because lead crosses the placenta and 
can impair brain development in a fetus. 
Health authorities recommend screening children up to 6 years of age. One- to 
3-year-olds are considered most vulnerable because they are undergoing rapid 
neurological and physical development and are prone to put their hands and 
dust-covered objects in their mouths. At that age, children also are more 
likely to have iron deficiency, which makes them more susceptible to lead 
poisoning. 
Lead attacks the brain, which is still developing in young children and the 
fetus. The metal can reduce a child's intelligence and cause hearing problems, 
hyperactivity, impaired reaction time, impulsiveness and difficulty in 
persisting in a task. The effects are often permanent, even after medical 
treatment. 
The Gibsons' 3 1/2-year-old son, Walker, was poisoned by dust about a year ago 
when his father used a sander, a heat gun and a scraper to remove several 
layers of old paint from elaborate moldings and door frames in their newly 
purchased home. 
"I was trying to bring out the detail of the wood -- lovingly restoring an old 
home," the Charleston attorney said. 
Shared Picnic Lunches 
Before moving in, he worked on the house on the weekends and his wife and son 
brought him picnic lunches which they shared on the floor. "Of course Walker 
thought it was great fun," Wendy Gibson recalled. "He thought he was in some 
cave somewhere. We would pull over a box and sit down to eat." 
"I look back at it," she said in a flat voice, "and cringe." 
"He would have a cookie or a sandwich in the midst of all this lead paint," his 
father said. "It was the dust. We never saw him with anything (such as paint 
chips) in his mouth." 
Although Walker had no symptoms, his pediatrician recommended that he be tested 
for lead because of the remodeling. His level was more than twice the national 
average, and after moving into their new home, it climbed above 25 micrograms 
per deciliter of blood, the level considered toxic by public health 
authorities. 
Frightened and nearly "hysterical," Wendy moved him and her newborn son, 
Andrew, to Florida to stay with her parents while Allen worked with public 
health authorities to clean out the lead dust. 
"We had so looked forward to involving ourselves in restoring a historic old 
home," she said, "and then I just felt angry that we had bothered at all. I was 
ready to sell the house and move back." 
Not Warned of Danger 
Besides the disappointment, there was bitterness that no one had warned her of 
the dangers. She called friends who had done similar work, and they, too, were 
unaware. "I don't think people realize how common it is," she said, looking out 
her window and watching workers scrape the paint off her neighbor's equally 
historic home. "It is probably happening, and people don't realize it." 
At relatively low levels, such as Walker's, the effects of lead may be 
invisible to parents or doctors. It is only when such children are studied in 
populations that differences are noticed. Toddlers who were exposed to lead in 
the womb and in the first year of life score lower on cognitive development 
tests than other children. 
Although the Centers for Disease Control recommend intervention at 25 
micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, that level is undergoing review and 
is expected to be lowered within a year. Recent epidemiological studies from 
Greece, Scotland and Denmark have found that children with blood lead levels as 
low as 10 and 15 micrograms per deciliter scored an average of 4 to 7 points 
lower on IQ tests than children who were not exposed. 
Walker's highest level was 31 micrograms per deciliter, and his brother, 
Andrew, now 15 months old, was tested at 1 year old and had a level of 11. For 
an individual child, however, it is virtually impossible to predict what effect 
low-level exposure will have because reactions and vulnerability can vary 
significantly. What damages one may leave another unchanged. 
Epidemiologists' Concern 
Moreover, the loss of a few IQ points may have relatively little effect on an 
individual's lifetime achievement. Indeed, much of the concern of 
epidemiologists is the effect on a population in which even low lead exposure 
significantly reduces the number of people with superior intelligence and 
raises the number who are below average. 
Dr. Herbert Needleman, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the 
University of Pittsburgh and a leading authority on lead and children, said the 
loss of IQ points from lead may not be as detrimental to a child's future as 
the other effects of poisoning. 
"The ability to persist in boring work is important because that's what a lot 
of school is -- very boring," he said. "Distractibility, persistence, 
impulsiveness, frustration, all those things are affected by lead." 
Needleman studied asymptomatic lead-intoxicated children whose levels at the 
time they were measured did not exceed the then-higher federal health 
guidelines. For the high group, the average lead level was 35 micrograms per 
deciliter; the low group had an average of 24 micrograms. 
In the first and second grades, the children with the higher lead levels scored 
lower on IQ tests and on scales measuring auditory and language function and 
attention span. Teachers who were unaware of the lead levels rated those with 
the higher exposure more distractable, disorganized, hyperactive and impulsive. 
Likely to Be Held Back 
By the fifth grade, those with the higher levels were more likely to be held 
back a grade or referred for special services. 
By age 18 or 19, those with the higher levels had more reading disabilities, 
lower scores on vocabulary, grammatical reasoning and fine motor tests and 
slower reaction times. There were also more high school dropouts among the 
high-lead group. 
Because many lead-intoxicated children do not have symptoms, particularly at 
low levels, poisoning cases may often go undetected. An Oakland couple, for 
example, did not discover that their children had been poisoned two years ago 
until their cat became sick. A veterinarian diagnosed lead poisoning. 
Subsequent tests on the couple's two toddlers found enough lead in their blood 
to require hospitalization for chelation, the removal of lead from the blood. 
The children had been poisoned during the renovation of their Victorian home. 
Some lead specialists speculate that poorer children are more likely to be 
tested for lead than higher-income youngsters because of a misperception that 
lead poisoning is only a poor person's disease. Dr. J. Routt Reigart, a 
pediatrician at the Medical University of South Carolina and an expert on 
childhood lead poisoning, maintains that any neighborhood that has housing 60 
to 100 years old has a problem. "I would almost bet on it," he said. 
Testing Begins 
Health authorities in Charleston began testing low-income children for lead 16 
years ago and found that about 40% had above 40 micrograms per deciliter in 
their blood, he said. But few affluent children were tested until a recent 
series of articles in the city's newspaper raised parental anxiety and 
heightened pediatricians' awareness. 
"It's amazing how many of them are coming up with abnormal test results," 
Reigart said. He was interviewed as he waited at the hospital for the admission 
of the 28-month-old grandchild of a prominent surgeon in town, a baby girl who 
had been poisoned during the renovation of her home. Her blood lead that day 
had reached 60 micrograms per deciliter. 
"Our experience has been that . . . in somewhere between 70% and 80% of people 
who do renovations without removing their children from the house, the children 
have elevated levels in their blood -- higher when the family is doing the work 
themselves," he said. 
Many parents of children with learning disabilities now tell him they renovated 
old houses when the children were 1 or 2 years old. "They had vague symptoms 
that no one ever tied to the lead, and now they have learning problems," 
Reigart said. "That's what we are trying to prevent." 
The most tragic cases, of course, are bright youngsters who were mentally 
retarded after eating large amounts of lead, usually in paint chips. Physicians 
who have treated such children describe playful, alert toddlers who reached 
their developmental milestones on time -- learning to walk, talk and interact 
normally -- only to end up mentally impaired and in remedial classes at school. 
Children Lose Skills 
"You have no real feeling for just what a terrible thing this can be until you 
run into a mother or a grandmother taking care of a child and she said, 'Oh 
yes, Johnny, he doesn't tie his shoes anymore,' and they call him in, and you 
are looking at a little kid who has been lead-poisoned," said Jim Simpson, a 
public health adviser for the Centers for Disease Control who witnessed such a 
scene many years ago in New Orleans. 
The prospects are brighter but still uncertain for Reina Rugerio, 3, of Long 
Beach, who was in danger of going into convulsions from lead poisoning two 
months ago. Bright-eyed with dark thick lashes and a ponytail, Reina betrayed 
no trace of illness while at home three weeks ago, skipping around the tidy 
living room, eating Popsicles and proudly showing off her necklaces. 
She had been eating paint for several weeks, peeling it with her fingernails 
from a metal water heater closet in the back yard, before she was diagnosed 
with lead poisoning. Her mother said she tried many times to break Reina of 
eating paint, finally slapping the child across the mouth in desperation and 
even trying a paint chip herself to discover the appeal. 
"It tasted like chalk," Areli Maravilla, 23, an immigrant from El Salvador, 
said through an interpreter. "Reina liked the crunch of it." 
Symptoms Described 
The girl developed severe nosebleeds, waking up in the mornings in a pool of 
blood with the sheets soaked. "I got very frightened because my daughter had 
always been very active and playful, and she wouldn't eat and she wouldn't 
play," her mother recalled, sitting in their living room, filled with plants 
and plastic flowers and pictures of children. "It got to the point that she was 
afraid to go to bed at night." 
At first, anemia was diagnosed and only later lead poisoning. Reina was 
hospitalized in May for chelation therapy. Her lead level, however, rose again 
and she returned to the hospital last month. 
"I definitely do worry about the long range but I don't know for sure right now 
what could happen because they haven't explained that much to me," Maravilla 
said. 
It is this uncertainty about the long-term consequences that haunts parents of 
lead victims. 
"I would find myself asking, 'Oh my God, is she acting more hyperactive than 
usual? Is that because of the lead? Is she having an attention deficit right 
now?' " said Minda Bernstein, 36, whose 21-month-old daughter, Zoe, was 
poisoned last summer. "I couldn't help myself." 
Bernstein said she had to make herself come to terms with her fears. "I didn't 
want to be asking every time she got a low grade on a math test, was it because 
of the lead? I finally made a conscious decision to try to lay it to rest, and 
with time, it is getting easier." 
Had Taken Precautions 
A bright child with light blue eyes and dark blonde hair cut in a pixie, Zoe 
was poisoned when her parents, concerned about the peeling lead paint in their 
New York country home, tried to remove it for her safety. They were aware of 
the dangers of removal, and they took precautions to protect her. 
Much of the woodwork was taken outside to be stripped, and the rest done on the 
second story of the 17-room house. The family remained isolated in two rooms 
that they thought they had sealed from the rest of the house. At the end of 
each day, the house was vacuumed thoroughly. 
It was all futile. Vacuuming just spread the tiny lead particles: They escaped 
through the holes in the bag. On a rainy day, Zoe's father, Harle Thomas, 40, 
accidentally tracked in a paint chip. Zoe ate part of it before her horrified 
parents could get it out of her mouth. 
They called a poison-control center. Officials there told them not to worry 
about a single paint chip but to get Zoe tested eventually because of the 
paint-removal work in the house. Nearly three months after the work began, Zoe 
had a lead level of 37 micrograms per deciliter, and she was hospitalized for 
chelation. The dust, not the chip, was to blame. 
Intelligence a Consolation 
Bernstein said her only consolation is Zoe's obvious intelligence. She is alert 
and talkative, successfully attempting such words as "condominium" and 
"curious," and seems to be developing on target or even in advance of 
expectations. But no medical expert will tell Bernstein that her child has 
suffered no permanent damage, an assurance the mother "repeatedly wanted to 
hear," and she has found no comfort in reading reams of scientific reports 
about lead in children. 
Rosen, the professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
in New York, evaluated Zoe's case and advised her parents on treatment. 
"She has very supportive, interested parents, and if she has lost a couple of 
IQ points, her nurturing environment is a great compensation to fall back on," 
said Rosen, an expert on diagnosing and treating lead intoxication. "So I am 
optimistic. Hopefully, she will be all right or, to the extent there is a loss 
of potential, it will be very minor for her."
