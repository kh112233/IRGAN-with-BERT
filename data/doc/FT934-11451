FT  01 NOV 93 / Chinese shot in corruption purge
CHINA executed seven officials over the weekend, including the mayor of a
small town in southern Henan province, as a nationwide anti-corruption drive
gathered pace. Dozens of bureaucrats have been shot recently for crimes
ranging from bribe-taking to extortion and embezzlement.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, hailed the executions as
'another achievement' for the party and the 'entire Chinese people'.
'To severely punish corrupt leading officials according to law is absolutely
necessary for ensuring the purity of our party and state power, maintaining
social stability and promoting the establishment of a socialist market
economy,' the paper said.
China launched its anti-corruption drive several months ago in the face of
widespread grumbling among citizens about official graft and bribe-taking.
The campaign has taken on some of the characteristics of a national crusade
led by a Communist party desperate to shore up its public support.
Members of the standing committee of China's parliament, the National
People's Congress, meeting at the weekend, charged that 'corruption had
reached an alarming rate in China, damaging the party style and harming the
image of the party and the government. It had also eroded social conduct'.
Mr Li Ligong, a standing committee member, urged that the anti-corruption
campaign should be carried out regularly and be institutionalised. 'The
masses should be fully mobilised to inform on offenders,' he declared.
According to China's prosecutor general, corruption is rife among Communist
party officials. He reported to parliament last week that in one out of 10
criminal cases investigated in the first nine months of this year, offenders
were party or government officials.
By September, 5,040 party and government officials, including 20 at
department or city level, and one at vice-ministerial level, were charged
with committing crimes such as embezzlement.
