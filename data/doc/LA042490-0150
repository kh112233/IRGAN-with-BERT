ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 
TOY POLICE CAR TO AID IN ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
The Police Department will add a miniature, remote-controlled police car to its 
arsenal to help spread an anti-drug message to young students. 
The four-foot-long police car has a two-way transmitter that allows the car to 
seemingly talk and listen to students while an officer operates the car from a 
short distance away. 
The City Council unanimously agreed to buy the robotic car using $6,550 in 
community donations earmarked for it. The department expects to receive the new 
car in about a week. 
"It really is an attention-getter," Sgt. Joe Klein said. The operator can drive 
the car around, make it do wheelies and even make it dance to music, he said. 
The car will be a tool for police officers to spread an anti-drug message to 
students from kindergarten through fourth grades, Klein said. The department 
might also use the car to break the ice with young crime victims, he said. 
"Little kids will feel more comfortable talking to a robot or a little car like 
this" rather than an adult police officer, he said.
