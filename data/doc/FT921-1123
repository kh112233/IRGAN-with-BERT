FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: GBL lifted by dividend and
interest income
GROUPE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company headed by financier Mr
Albert Frere, pushed up consolidated profits by 23 per cent to BFr7bn
(Dollars 205m) last year, helped by a heavy increase in interest and
dividend receipts. The group reported profits of BFr5.7bn for 1990.
The directors have proposed increasing net dividend from BFr140 to BFr142.5
per share. Although the increase is smaller than many analysts had expected,
GBL denied it had held back the payout in order to add to its substantial
cash reserves.
Interest on reserves and dividends increased from less than BFr100m to
BFr1.6bn last year. 'The (cash) amount is clearly comfortable and we could
make a large investment without having to run to the banks,' said a
spokesman, who refused to give details of the group's finances.
GBL, which owns stakes in many of Belgium's largest industrial and financial
groups, is said by some analysts to have nearly BFr30bn of cash on its
balance sheet, following a number of judicious stake sales over the last two
years.
In 1991, GBL sold part of its stake in Royale Belge, the Belgian insurance
company, and Banque Internationale a Luxembourg. However, capital gains of
BFr3.2bn were broadly the same as in 1990.
The figures, announced after the close of the Brussels stock market, were in
line with analysts' most recent expectations, although a number of brokers
had downgraded their forecasts since the beginning of the year following
poor results from some companies in which GBL has a holding.
The group said the bulk - about BFr5.1bn - of its final profit was accounted
for by interest, dividends and GBL's share in the results of other
companies.
