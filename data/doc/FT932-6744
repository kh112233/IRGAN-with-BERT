FT  27 MAY 93 / Nation lags in R&amp;D spending
INTERNATIONAL compar-isons provide the main support for lobby groups such as
Save British Science, as they argue for the UK to strengthen the voice of
science in government and to spend more on research and development.
Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
only reliable source of international statistics, show that the UK fell back
in relation to other industrialised countries during the 1981-91 decade on
almost every measure of spending.
During the 1970s the UK had kept more or less in pace with its international
competitors, in terms of the percentage of gross domestic product devoted to
science. But the 1980s and early 1990s have seen a substantial slide in the
UK position in both government and industrial R&amp;D.
UK public spending on non-military R&amp;D, the area at the heart of the white
paper, fell from 0.72 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 0.49 per cent in 1991. This
resulted especially from cuts in support for near-market research in areas
of relevance to industry, cuts not matched by any other industrialised
country.
Save British Science has been calling unsuccessfully for a government
commitment to raise its civil R&amp;D over five years to 0.8 per cent of GDP,
the level it says is the minimum required to maintain a competitive
international position.
Even the Japanese government, which has until now spent only a relatively
small amount to support the country's huge industrial research effort, is
planning to double its R&amp;D budget from the present 0.5 per cent of GDP.
Japanese industrial leaders see this increased investment in basic science
not as a luxury but as an essential foundation for the country's
competitiveness in the 21st century.
