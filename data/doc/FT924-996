FT  21 DEC 92 / EC to study fisheries
EC ministers yesterday agreed to overhaul their common fisheries programme
and reduce catch quotas next year to counter over-fishing, AP reports from
Brussels.
Although the Twelve did not accept all proposals of the EC's Commission to
guarantee sufficient stocks over the next decade, the deal still went well
beyond the current programme by introducing fishing licences by 1995 and
tougher fishing controls.
