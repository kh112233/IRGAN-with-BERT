FT  21 OCT 93 / People: Bodies politic - Energy Advisory Panel
The government has chosen an expert on Antarctica to be the first chairman
of the new ENERGY ADVISORY PANEL of independent experts which will advise on
the way energy markets may develop in the future.
Martin Holdgate, the former chairman of the Renewable Energy Advisory Group,
is currently director general of the Swiss-based International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, whose membership embraces
countries, national agencies and non-governmental organisations.
Educated at Arnold School in Blackpool and at Queens College, Cambridge,
Holdgate lectured at Manchester University and Durham College before turning
his attention to Antarctica, where he served as senior biologist with the
British Antarctic Survey in the early 1960s.
He later served with the Department of Environment as chief scientist before
moving to the Department of Transport as chief scientific adviser.
His experience in Antarctica served him well as chairman of the Commonwealth
Expert Group on Climate Change in the last 1980s.
