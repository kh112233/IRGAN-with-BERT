  [Abstract] In recent years, a great deal of progress has 
been made in the development and refinement of new means and 
methods of space geodesy, one task of which involves the 
precision study of the fine structure of the geopotential over 
the World Ocean. Today, the primary method of performing that 
task is satellite altimetry. This paper examines the principal 
approaches to determining gravitational-field characteristics -- 
i.e., geoidal rise and gravity anomalies over the water bodies 
of the World Ocean -- and the results obtained with Geo-IK 
satellite altimetry information collected over the past five 
years. The main type of baseline data derives from some 18 
million radio altimetry measurements. Two models are used to 
compute geoidal rise and gravity anomalies from those 
measurements: lunar-solar tides and maritime topographic 
surface. Geoidal-rise and gravity-anomaly catalogs based on 
Geos-3 and Seasat data were used to check and analyze the 
results, as were gravimetric maps of the northeastern Pacific 
and the Sea of Okhotsk. Also used for that purpose were class IV 
maritime gravimetric surveys of the central Atlantic and average 
1 x 1 gravity-anomaly values for the entire surface of 
the Earth. The measurements were processed in five stages: 
computation of geoidal rise; regional adjustment of altimeter 
tracks; processing of adjusted geoidal rises; global adjustment 
of geoidal rise; and computation of gravity anomalies from the 
geoidal rises. The gravity-anomaly catalog produced is among the 
most precise such catalogs published today for anomalies over 
the World Ocean. References 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.
