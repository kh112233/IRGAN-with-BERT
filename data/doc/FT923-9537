FT  05 AUG 92 / EC to cost Sweden SKr3.4bn a year
MEMBERSHIP of the European Community will cost Sweden only SKr3.4bn (Pounds
330m) net a year, according to a Commission report issued yesterday.
Sweden's contribution would amount to 3.2 per cent of the EC's annual
spending.
Although Sweden will have to pay an estimated SKr10.8bn a year into the EC
budget, it can expect to receive SKr7.4bn in return in financial support,
particularly for its vulnerable agricultural industry. Between SKr4.4bn and
SKr5.2bn will be earmarked for supporting cereals, milk and dairy products,
lamb and mutton.
The report makes it clear that Swedish accession to the EC 'would represent
an important challenge for agriculture, resulting in lower prices, reduced
support level and increased competition'.
It noted, however, that Swedish cereals surpluses, which have been
eliminated under the reforms, could reappear as Sweden adopted EC farm
programmes.
The report also calculated that Sweden would benefit from an annual SKr1.5bn
in regional aid.
It suggests that the abolition of the state monopoly on the production of
spirits, the marketing and importing of all types of alcohol and export of
all spirits and strong beers would also be necessary as a condition of EC
membership. In the Commission's view, Sweden's state alcohol monopoly is the
'most worrying' because it conflicts with EC competition laws.
