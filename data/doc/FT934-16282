FT  07 OCT 93 / Tourist numbers at record level
TOURIST numbers and spending rose to record levels in the first seven months
of the year, but a travel industry spokesman warned that London theatres
were missing opportunities to attract foreign visitors.
The number of visitors to the UK rose 3 per cent to 10.6m in the year to the
end of July, according to department of national heritage figures. Spending
was up 12 per cent to Pounds 4.7bn. During July spending was Pounds 1.1bn,
21 per cent higher than last year.
Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, said the figures provided
'further evidence that the United Kingdom is an attractive and affordable
place to visit'.
However, Mr Stuart Crouch, chairman of the British Incoming Tour Operators'
Association, said London theatres were losing foreign visitors' bookings
through their 'arrogant attitude'.
Mr Crouch said many tour operators bringing tourists to the UK had stopped
selling theatre tickets because of the difficulties they experienced.
These included theatres marking up ticket prices by as much as 10 per cent
on telephone sales and credit card transactions. Mr Crouch said: 'What sort
of message are we giving to clients and government legislators attempting to
outlaw the worst practices of ticket touts if theatre managements are
charging additional fees over and above the face value of the ticket?'
He added that theatres were refusing to hold tickets provisionally for 48
hours pending confirmation and payment.
Farmers in Cumbria are to be offered free advice on developing tourism on
their farms, Chris Tighe writes.
About 1,000 Cumbrian farms, or 20 per cent, already have some form of
tourism enterprise. Research by Adas, the government-owned Agricultural
Development Advisory Service, indicates 63 per cent of farm tourism
operators in England see their enterprise as vitally important to overall
income.
