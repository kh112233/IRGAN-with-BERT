FT  28 SEP 94 / Electronics plant to expand
GEC Plessey Semiconductors, the UK's biggest semiconductor manufacturer,
yesterday announced a Pounds 100m expansion of its plant in Plymouth, which
could double the group's turnover within three years.
The investment is the biggest made by the group since 1990, reflecting
fast-growing international demand for semiconductors for use in
communications devices such as mobile phones and multimedia products.
More than 70 per cent of GPS's output is exported.
The move follows last week's announcement of a Pounds 530m semiconductor
investment in Scotland by NEC, the Japanese electronics company. Scotland
won the decision over NEC's biggest semiconductor plant in Roseville,
California.
GPS's plant at Roborough, Plymouth, is a state-of-the-art CMOS semiconductor
plant, one of the company's four facilities in the UK.
The expansion will quadruple its capacity and create a further 150 jobs.
GPS's turnover is expected to reach about Dollars 320m this year, and could
rise to more than Dollars 600m in three years as a result of the latest
expansion.
Mr Ernie Pusey, sales and marketing director, said: 'As we continue to grow
there will need to be further investments.' He said the new investment would
make the Plymouth plant 'one of the most advanced semiconductor facilities
in the world'.
GPT, the Coventry-based telecommunications equipment joint venture between
GEC and Siemens of Germany, has won orders worth about Pounds 18m for
'telepoint' mobile communications equipment for all big towns and cities in
Taiwan.
The order, which GPT says is the world's biggest yet for telepoint
equipment, is for more than 12,000 base stations and associated network
management systems.
