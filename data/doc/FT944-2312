FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Acatos advance 40% to
Pounds 14.2m
Rising edible oils prices kept margins under pressure at Acatos &amp; Hutcheson,
the manufacturer of edible oils and fats.
Pre-tax profits for the year to October 2 rose from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds
14.2m. However, the group pointed out that the 40 per cent gain was mainly
the effect of exceptional charges in both years relating to disposals and
restructuring.
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 13.7m, despite a 12 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 249m (Pounds 222m).
The shares closed 14p ahead at 264p.
In addition to raw material price increases, the group faced increased
competition on prices, citing two other refiners seeking to lift volumes
'with little regard to profit'. The group said it had 'responded as required
to maintain our market share'.
The bulk of the group's business lies in supplying own brand oils and fats
to UK supermarkets; it has about 30 per cent of the market.
Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said earlier this year that the insistence of
some customers that prices should be held in the face of unavoidable cost
increases had 'reached a level of unrealism we have not previously
experienced'.
At the end of September, the group said it was forming a strategic
relationship with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness group which
supplies its biggest refinery in London's Docklands.
It is also forming a 50-50 joint venture with the US group to build and
operate an edible oil refinery and bottling and canning plant beside ADM's
existing oil seed crushing plant at Erith, Kent.
Mr Hutcheson said yesterday that this, together with other joint ventures
and acquisitions, would 'further improve our competitiveness and I am
increasingly optimistic for the medium to long term once the planned
programme of restructuring and capital expenditure is complete'.
Earnings per share were up from 20.9p to 30.3p. A final dividend of 5.5p is
proposed, taking the total to 9p (8p).
