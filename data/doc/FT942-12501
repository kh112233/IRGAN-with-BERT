FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Ice-detectors save on de-icing
A new way of detecting ice on aircraft, developed by RVSI (Robotic Vision
Systems), has generated interest at the US Federal Aviation Administration,
which has awarded a Dollars 460,000 contract to fund further research.
The US company says its technology - called ID-1 and using electro-optical
methods - can be adapted to ground-based and airborne detection systems. The
compact, mobile sensor operates in the dark and in severe weather. As a
visual system with a video display, the ID-1 can pinpoint the location of
dangerous ice build-up.
RVSI says the device's precision also has environmental benefits, as
over-use of potentially hazardous de-icing fluids can be reduced.
