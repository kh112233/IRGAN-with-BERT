FT  20 JUN 92 / Czechoslovaks agree to form two nations
CZECH and Slovak leaders announced early today that they had agreed to
prepare the splitting up of Czechoslovakia into two separate states,
Agencies report from Bratislava.
The announcement came after almost 14 hours of negotiations in Bratislava
between teams headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, and his Slovak
counterpart, Mr Vladimir Meciar. The planned orderly break-up of the
74-year-old Czechoslovak federation comes in the wake of elections two weeks
ago.
In the poll Mr Meciar's nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS) performed strongly in the Slovak region. Mr Klaus, who as finance
minister carried through post-communist reforms, had a political victory in
the Czech republic.
The two leaders said they had agreed on forming a new interim federal
government and on its functions. The new government would 'prepare, if it is
authorised, conditions for a smooth functioning of two sovereign states with
international status,' Mr Klaus said.
The two men said the regional Czech and Slovak parliaments would decide on
how best to divide Czechoslovakia into two states. The legislative process
would begin in both parliaments on September 30.
Mr Meciar said: 'Both victorious political parties consider as a common task
to initiate by constitutional means a process that will lead by September 30
to an agreement between National Councils (regional parliaments) on the
issue of the state set-up.'
Mr Meciar had wanted to transform Czechoslovakia into a confederation. But
Mr Klaus's Civic Democratic party (ODS) rejected this, saying that if the
present federation was to be so loosened, it would be better to split.
The Slovak side also previously said it wanted a referendum on independence
early next year, postponing dissolution of the federation until the end of
1993. But such demands are unacceptable to the Czechs, who fear the crisis
could delay integration with the west.
