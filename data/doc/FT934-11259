FT  02 NOV 93 / Forth road bridge scheme attacked
THE GOVERNMENT'S conser-vation body in Scotland yesterday urged the Scottish
Office to consider alternative options to building a second Forth road
bridge.
Scottish Natural Heritage said that a second road bridge could have serious
effects on the 'natural heritage'.
The Scottish Office is expected to announce early next year whether it wants
to go ahead with the bridge.
However the office it has already invited construction companies to register
interest in building a privately funded bridge, and says it believes a
second bridge will be needed in the next century.
Scottish Natural Heritage said moves to build a second bridge reflected a
policy of accommodating projected growth in road traffic rather than
exploring alternatives under an integrated transport policy. It said a new
bridge would increase dependence on cars and boost emissions of carbon
dioxide.
It said only a comprehensive review which included the option of not
building a second bridge and looked at transport, economic activity,
settlement patterns and environmental quality would provide an adequate
context for a decision on the Forth crossing.
The heritage body was set up by the government last year to administer
nature conservation in Scotland.
Its shot across the government's bows over the bridge came on the day of the
formation of an alliance of environmental and transport groups which
condemned plans for a new bridge.
ForthRight proposed higher tolls on the existing bridge, more money for
public transport in the Edinburgh and south Fife areas, and road
improvements both north and south of the Forth.
