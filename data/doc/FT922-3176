FT  12 JUN 92 / Prague talks end in deadlock
A SECOND round of talks between the newly elected Czech and Slovak leaders
on the future of the Czechoslovak federation ended in deadlock last night,
bringing closer the possibility of a formal split between the two republics.
After nine hours of talks, Mr Vaclav Klaus, Czech winner in the poll,
admitted no agreement had been reached with Mr Valdimir Meciar, his Slovak
counterpart. 'We haven't made any progress, not a single step forward, and
the Slovak side continues to refuse our deadline for forming a federal
government,' he said.
Mr Klaus has urged that a new federal government be formed before July 5,
when the re-election of President Vaclav Havel is due in the federal
parliament. This re-election is likely in itself to cause a Czech-Slovak
clash. Mr Meciar has refused to support Mr Havel's candidacy, while the
Czechs have said they will not accept another candidate.
But the Slovak delegation said it could not commit itself to a deadline on
forming a new federal structure. So far, it has agreed only to a temporary
federal government until a referendum on independence is held in Slovakia
towards the end of the year.
