FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian rubber and tin output
decline further
Malaysia's declining role as a commodity producer is highlighted by
statistics released here on 1993 rubber and tin production - two commodities
in which, until fairly recently, Malaysia led the world.
The Malaysian department of statistics says the country's total natural
rubber production in 1993 was 1.07m tonnes, a drop of 98,000 tonnes, or 8
per cent, from the 1992 figure. Within that smallholder output declined 7
per cent while estate production dropped 12 per cent.
Exports of natural rubber also dropped - by 9 per cent to 937,000 tonnes.
The decline in tin-in-concentrates production was sharper, by 28 per cent to
10,384 tonnes in 1993.
Malaysia's is industrialising fast and commodities are playing a decreasing
role in the overall economy. Serious labour shortages and low prices are
also forcing people to abandon labour intensive agricultural activities.
A surge in car sales in the US is being seen as the main reason for a rally
in natural rubber prices which, after several months in the doldrums,
reached a five-year high on far eastern markets last week. Traders say tight
supply due to prolonged monsoon rains in rubber producing areas has also
helped prices.
