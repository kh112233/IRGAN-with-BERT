<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy has issued a study comparing the transportation alternatives for the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant (WIPP) transuranic waste shipping campaign in support of the disposal phase at the WIPP facility. The study
compares truck and train transport, including the use of dedicated trains. The study includes a consideration of
the following elements in association with each transportation mode: occupational and public risks and exposures,
other environmental impacts, emergency response capabilities, and an estimation of comparative costs. The report
is available upon request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

WIPP is a research and development facility located in Southeastern New Mexico with the mission to demonstrate the
safe disposal of transuranic radioactive wastes resulting from defense activities and programs of the United States.
The study describes relevant transportation requirements and responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Energy,
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Responsibilities of States,
local governments, and Indian tribes are also included. The proposed transportation system is discussed which includes:
The shipping containers to be used, the transportation fleet, shipment options, waste volumes, training, and the
transportation tracking system. Risk analysis data is represented in the study in terms of occupational health and
public exposure risks, as well as environmental impacts associated with the proposed WIPP shipping campaign. Emergency
response capabilities for accidents involving radioactive materials for the states through which transuranic
waste will be transported during the disposal phase are outlined. Finally, cost comparative data is presented for
transportation by truck, regular train, and dedicated train.
