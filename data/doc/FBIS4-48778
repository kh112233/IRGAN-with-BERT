  [Text] Kinshasa, May 27 (AFP) -- Activity in central 
Kinshasa ground to a standstill Friday [27 May] as shops, 
offices and markets closed following a call for public protest 
by the radical wing of Zaire's opposition. Supporters of 
Etienne Tshisekedi, one of Zaire's rival "prime ministers" and 
an implacable foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko, called on 
people not to go to work to press for implementation of a 
transitional constitution. 
  Few vehicles took to the streets of central Kinshasa, and in 
outlying districts of the capital, such as Massina, Lemba and 
Linguala, children played football in wide avenues empty of 
traffic. Trains owned by the private companies City-Train and 
Sotraz were running but largely empty. 
  The radical wing of the Sacred Union opposition movement 
called for the work stoppage after the transitional parliament 
seized all the files of candidates for the post of prime 
minister. The radicals consider Tshisekedi, who was appointed 
premier by a national conference convened four years ago, the 
only opposition candidate, but moderates in the Sacred Union 
have put up three other names. Mobutu sacked Tshisekedi last 
year and appointed a new prime minister, Faustin Birindwa, but 
the opposition leader has refused to recognise his dismissal. 
  No trouble was reported during the protest Friday. 
  In Zaire's second city, Lubumbashi, capital of the 
mineral-rich southeastern province of Shaba, work continued as 
usual, according to several sources in the private sector 
reached by telephone. Shaba has declared its autonomy, amid 
economic and political chaos in the country.
