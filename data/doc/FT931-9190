FT  16 FEB 93 / Terrorism costs Egypt Dollars 700m in lost earnings from
tourists
MR FOUAD SULTAN, Egypt's tourism minister, said yesterday that Moslem
militant attacks on foreign tourists had cost the country Dollars 700m
(Pounds 496m), Reuter reports from Cairo.
Despite tough security measures taken by the government to safeguard the
country's main source of foreign currency, hoteliers and tourist operators
say business is slack.
Mr Sultan said militant attacks, in which one British woman was killed and
two Britons and five Germans were wounded late last year, caused a 20 per
cent reduction in revenues compared with the same period the year before.
'Between Dollars 60m and Dollars 70m is lost in receipts each month. The
losses have reached about Dollars 700m so far,' Mr Sultan said. 'If that
pace continues, the losses in the fiscal year 1992-93 (which ends in June)
will reach about Dollars 1bn.'
He said that when calculating revenues based on government forecasts, the
losses could be even more. Egypt had expected 4m visitors for the fiscal
year 1992-93 and more than Dollars 4bn in revenues.
Mr Sultan said in the year 1991-92 an estimated 3m tourists visited Egypt,
generating Dollars 3.5bn.
He said the tourism industry accounted for 30 per cent of Egypt's foreign
currency receipts and 10 per cent of its gross domestic product.
Many people employed in the tourism business fear for their jobs.
The pyramids and ancient Pharaonic temples - Egypt's main tourist
attractions - are virtually empty. Luxury hotels, tourist villages and Red
Sea beaches are quiet. Egyptian hoteliers are nostalgic about the boom days.
Boats and river cruisers lie idle along the banks of the Nile waiting for
clients. Souvenir shops have everything except shoppers.
