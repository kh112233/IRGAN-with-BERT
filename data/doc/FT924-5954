FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: 'Disgraceful' for ABI to remove cover
Sir, I have been waiting in vain for the tide of protest to flood through
your columns at the news from the Association of British Insurers that
commercial cover for damage from terrorist action on the mainland is to be
withdrawn.
This decision is, quite simply, a disgraceful act which exposes businesses
to punitive losses and partnerships to bankruptcy. At a stroke it accepts a
terrorist threat as an established part of life and thereby hands a
considerable propaganda coup to the malefactors. How does the City and the
government propose to respond?
