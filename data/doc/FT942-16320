FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Kashima Oil chief to quit after
forex loss
The president of Kashima Oil, a Japanese refiner, has said he would resign
to take responsibility for the company's loss of Y152.5bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in
foreign exchange forward transactions.
The loss is the second biggest in foreign exchange forward transactions
after a Y166.3bn loss incurred by Showa Shell Sekiyu early last year. Its
reflects the vulnerable position of Japanese oil companies which have huge
foreign currency needs in the face of fluctuating currency markets.
Mr Hachiro Obata, the president, resigned over the weekend after the oil
refiner's loss was made public.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which last year launched
an investigation into the effect of forward contracts on oil companies after
Showa Shell's loss, plans to investigate Kashima. The ministry said its
investigation would not affect Kashima's normal business.
Kashima, an unlisted oil refiner with facilities in Kashima city north-east
of Tokyo, is 25 per cent owned by Japan Energy, a mining development and
petroleum refining company. Other leading shareholders include Mitsubishi
Petroleum, also with 25 per cent and Cosmo Oil, with 22 per cent.
The company's foreign exchange loss far exceeds its capitalisation of Y20bn,
so it will have to seek capital injections from major shareholders, as well
as assistance from the Industrial Bank of Japan, its main bank. Japan Energy
said it was in talks with the company on a rescue package.
