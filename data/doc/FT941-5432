FT  07 MAR 94 / Fewer than 100 schools to be axed
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, still plans to cut surplus school
places by closing schools, but fewer than 100 will be shut, his department
said yesterday.
New powers contained in the Education Act 1993, which comes into force in
April, give Mr Patten the ability to force local authorities to take action
to close schools. He has already asked authorities to review their surplus
places and come up with proposals on how to tackle them.
The Department for Education denied a report in yesterday's Observer
newspaper that as many as 1,000 schools would be closed.
It said: 'That would be a huge number. I don't expect it will be that high
for a minute. It will be in the tens.'
Ministers are anxious to tackle spare school places, which reached 1.3m in
England's 4,000 secondary and 18,000 primary schools when they were last
counted in 1991.
The Treasury is said to have completed a review which found that Pounds 310m
could be saved by getting rid of the excess places.
