FT  07 FEB 94 / People: Vulture or defender in Venezeula?
Not everybody was pleased by the appointment of Julio Sosa as Venezuela's
new finance minister, writes Joseph Mann. One left-wing opposition
politician suggested, in the charming manner that characterises Venezuelan
politics, that putting Sosa at the head of the finance ministry was like
'putting a vulture in charge of dead meat'.
Others have a higher opinion. Some businessmen and investors felt that Sosa
could emerge as a defender of free market policies or, at the very least,
could steer the new government away from economic blunders.
He will have his work cut out. As President Rafael Caldera began his
five-year term last Wednesday, Venezuela faces a profound economic crisis:
the economy is in recession and inflation rising. The government is short of
money because of the low price of oil and the country's second largest bank
collapsed last month.
Sosa has been close to the new president for decades, both as an adviser and
a friend. Caldera admits he is not an expert in economy and finance, and
will rely heavily on Sosa's opinions.
During the first Caldera presidency from 1969-74, Sosa refused a cabinet
position, but worked as ambassador to Washington. A father of nine children,
Sosa graduated in petroleum engineering in 1945. He studied at Cornell and
Oklahoma Universities in the US, as well as at Venezuela's Central
University.
He was born into a wealthy Venezuelan family and, after working as a
petroleum engineer and an academic, became a successful entrepreneur. He
founded and ran Industrias Venoco, a lubricants company, and set up a
commercial bank (Banco Orinoco) and an insurance company (Seguros Orinoco).
On his first day in office, Sosa was asked for his plans. He replied: 'Well,
I'm going to try to start doing what I'll be asking everyone else to do -
cutting costs.'
