THE STATE; 
TOBACCO TAX CHANGE URGED 
After being told that cigar smokers are placing their orders through the mail 
to escape California's heavy new tax on tobacco products, the chairman of the 
Joint Legislative Budget Committee said he wants the State Board of 
Equalization to come up with "a fairer" tax. Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights) said he thinks the board, in interpreting Proposition 99, the tobacco 
tax initiative approved by voters last November, has set the tax on selected 
tobacco products so high that it will create a black market and drive 
California tobacco shop owners out of business. He said he will draft a 
legislative resolution asking the tax agency to reduce the new levy.
