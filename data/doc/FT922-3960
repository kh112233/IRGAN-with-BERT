FT  09 JUN 92 / German poll shows support for referendum
ALMOST three-quarters of Germans believe that Germany should have a
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European political and economic
union, according to the latest opinion poll.
At the same time, 56 per cent of those questioned for Stern magazine, on the
day after Denmark voted against the Maastricht treaty on European union,
still favour the idea of union, but 72 per cent opposed the abolition of the
Deutsche Mark. Just 22 per cent were positively in favour of a single
European currency.
Some 70 per cent of those questioned by the Dortmund-based Forsa opinion
research institute said they believed Germany should retain its full
sovereignty to decide questions of foreign and security policy, social,
economic and financial policy - suggesting widespread ignorance of the
degree to which such responsibility has already been transferred to EC
institutions.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, rejected the growing pressure
for a German referendum on Maastricht, saying that such a vote was not
provided for in the German constitution.
