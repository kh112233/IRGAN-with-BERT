FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Tudor
Tudor, the USM-quoted tiling group, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 325,000 to just Pounds 23,000 in the year to December 31.
At the same time it announced the acquisition of the ceramic tile and
adhesive business of MGB Tiles, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manders, the
inks, paints and property group.
The acquisition will be incorporated into Tudor's United Tile subsidiary.
The total consideration is Pounds 1.87m via the issue to Manders of 5.24m
new ordinary Tudor shares at 20p apiece. This will represent a little less
than 48 per cent of the enlarged share capital, following the purchase.
Tudor's turnover edged ahead to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 12.3m) in 1991 and
trading profits dropped to Pounds 303,000 (Pounds 474,000). Earnings came to
0.72p (3.66p) and the final dividend is passed leaving a total for the year
of 0.5p (2.7p).
