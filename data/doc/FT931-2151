FT  22 MAR 93 / Change to national curriculum urged
RADICAL CHANGES are needed to the national curriculum if the government's
educational reforms are not to fail, a pamphlet published today by the
rightwing Centre for Policy Studies says.
The centre was responsible for shaping much of the reform programme.
The pamphlet says the national curriculum has become too prescriptive and
should be limited to essentials. It should not occupy more than half the
school day, nor should it cover more than half the time allotted to any
subject.
The pamphlet also calls for testing to be simplified. Short, simple, pencil
and paper tests are more objective, cheaper and less time-consuming for
teachers, the centre says.
The pamphlet is published amid growing concern among Conservative education
thinkers about the progress of the government's education reforms.
Written by Professor Anthony O'Hear, a leading government adviser on
education, the pamphlet says that raising standards requires greater choice
and diversity in schools.
Prof O'Hear echoes widespread concern about the forms of compulsory testing
introduced for all children at 7, 11 and 14. Simplifying the tests and
increasing their rigour should be a priority for the new School Curriculum
and Assessment Authority, he says.
