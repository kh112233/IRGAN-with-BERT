FT  12 AUG 94 / Observer: No kidding
General Motors has only itself to blame for the presence in this world of
another potential antagonist.
Uschi, wife of Volkswagen boss Ferdinand Piech and recently delivered of her
third child, a jolly little chap called Gregor, says she fell pregnant last
September - which she claims was also the height of the brouhaha over GM's
allegations of industrial espionage against her 57-year-old husband's newish
recruit, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. 'They got us into such a tizzy
that I clean forgot my pill and it just happened,' she divulges to Stern
magazine.
Perhaps she should consult last year's office diary. Conception apart, the
big events for father Ferdinand last September were actually the sudden
appearance of a whacking loss at VW's Seat subsidiary in Spain, and his
abrupt scrapping of an international finance deal for Skoda, hours before it
was due to be signed. The Lopez affair was going through a rare quiet spell.
Piech himself was not distracted from his one-man crusade to counter
Germany's falling birth rate. According to best estimates, the fruits of the
deceptively
robust auto engineer's loins now number 13.
