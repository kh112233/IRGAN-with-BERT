FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
TURNOVER in traded options rocketed yesterday, leaving Footsie futures in
the shade, as one institution, optimistic for the stock market's future
prospects, carried out a number of bullish trades, writes Peter John.
Volume in the options sector of the Liffe topped 50,000 contracts, the
highest for some time, lifted by hefty put writing or selling. The writing
of a put, an option giving the right but not the obligation to sell stock at
a certain price and at a fixed time, is a more aggressive ploy than buying
calls. That is taking up the right to buy stock at a certain price. It makes
money immediately but has a high downside risk in the event of the
underlying share price falling.
The top traded options were BTR with 4,434 lots, the equivalent of nearly
4.5m shares, BT with 3,641 lots and Lasmo with 2,717 contracts. The Euro
Footsie option was also very active, with more than 8,500 contracts changing
hands.
Meanwhile, the Footsie future contract for September delivery was almost
dead in the water with only 5,760 contracts dealt. It was sharply lower for
most of the day, hitting 2,935, at which stage it was priced at a premium of
only 3 points above the cash market.
However, a late burst of activity sent it up to 2,952 by the official close,
near the high of the day and at a 10-point premium to cash, compared with a
fair value of 4.
