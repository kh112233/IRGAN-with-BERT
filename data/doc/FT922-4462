FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: USAir gains concessions worth
Dollars 55m from pilots
USAIR, the ailing US airline whose losses have topped Dollars 750m after tax
during the past two years, said it had secured wage concessions worth
Dollars 55m from its pilots over the next 12 months.
The carrier added that when a new four-year contract agreed with the Air
Line Pilots Association is fully implemented, annual savings should total
Dollars 100m.
USAir is among the most financially-fragile carriers in the US, although it
has stayed out of bankruptcy. Last autumn, it announced a plan designed to
cut operating costs by over Dollars 400m.
This involved progressive salary reductions for non-contract employees when
at least one of its three big unions agreed to do the same - a condition
fulfilled by the ALPA agreement. USAir executives agreed to take salary
reductions with effect from January 1, regardless of union actions.
The cost-savings, however, come as prospects for the US airline industry
remain bleak, with few analysts expecting it to show a profit this year. The
latest round of domestic fare competition has been intense, with travel
agents reporting computer 'crashes' as travellers scramble to secure cheap
fares before these expire.
