TRAVEL QUESTIONS; 
AMISH CATER TO TOURISTS 
Question: We are visiting Pennsylvania and would like to go to the Dutch area. 
Are tourists welcome? 
 Answer: Although the Amish and Mennonites stick to their old customs, they are 
courteous to strangers and many cater to tourists by selling quilts and other 
handicrafts. The Lancaster area has good accommodations and other interesting 
attractions. Contact the Pennsylvania Dutch Visitors Bureau, 501 Greenfield 
Road, Lancaster, Pa. 17601. 
Q: My baggage was lost on a recent charter flight, but the airline refused to 
provide compensation. Isn't that illegal? 
 A: Unlike scheduled carriers, the charter operator isn't required to be 
responsible for damaged or lost baggage. This should be determined before 
boarding. Buying baggage insurance is wise before taking such flights. 
Q: There was no Bible in several of my hotel rooms. Aren't they required by 
law? 
 A: There's no such law, but Gideon's International of Nashville, Tenn., puts a 
free copy in every hotel and motel room in 140 countries, and will replace worn 
or missing copies. 
Q: I'm interested in a 1990 spring training baseball tour package. What do they 
cost and how can I make a booking? 
 A: Various major league clubs, including the Dodgers, have "fantasy camps" 
providing up to a week of instruction and playing time with big leaguers. Ask 
your travel agent to contact teams of your choice for available dates. Prices 
range from $2,000 and up per person, including accommodations and most meals.
