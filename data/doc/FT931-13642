FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite makes placing to raise Pounds 9.8m
SHARES in Shoprite, the Isle of Man-based discount food retailer which is
expanding rapidly in Scotland, leapt by 65p to 733p yesterday after it
announced plans to raise Pounds 9.8m through a placing and open offer to
shareholders.
The company is issuing 1.56m shares at 645p each, with the proceeds to be
used to reduce debt and fund further expansion.
The 1-for-9 open offer and placing has been underwritten in full by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
Shoprite, which also has vehicle retail and property interests on the Isle
of Man, acquired a distribution centre in Glasgow in July 1990. It has since
opened 35 deep-discount food stores in Scotland - 22 of them in the last
financial year.
The group has opened two more stores in Scotland so far this financial year,
with plans for 22 more.
Shoprite's chairman and managing director is Mr Deryck Nicholson, son of Mr
Ken Nicholson, co-founder with Mr Albert Gubay of the Kwik Save discount
chain.
The Nicholson family, which is interested in 60.7 per cent of Shoprite's
existing share capital, has undertaken not to take up its entitlement under
the open offer, amounting to 949,646 new ordinary shares.
Analysts said a number of institutional investors were yesterday chasing the
stock in the market.
