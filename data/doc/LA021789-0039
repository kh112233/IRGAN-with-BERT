THE STATE 
The Duquette Pavilion of St. Francis was badly damaged in a five-alarm fire 
that burned out of control for more than two hours, San Francisco fire 
officials said. The art collection suffered extensive damage in the blaze, said 
Fire Chief Fred Postel. The adjacent old Peoples Temple, operated during the 
70s by the Rev. Jim Jones, suffered extensive water damage but was not burned 
in the blaze. Postel said the roof of the pavilion, owned by San Francisco 
artist Tony Duquette, collapsed about 20 minutes after the department received 
the first reports of the fire. That nearly assured the destruction of its 
extensive collection of tapestries, sculptures, stained glass, paintings, 
objets d'art and an ornate, decorative ceiling. There were no reports of 
injuries.
