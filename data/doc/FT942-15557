FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Adidas upbeat despite sales fall
Adidas, the German sports-wear producer, is confident that new products and
changes in marketing strategy will boost results for the year.
'Adidas is in good shape and ready to go on the offensive to once again
become the leading sportswear maker in the world,' said Mr Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive.
The company reported 1993 profits of DM9m (Dollars 5.3m), compared with a
loss of DM149m last time. However, turnover was down 3 per cent, at
DM2.63bn, and worldwide turnover including licensees was down 1 per cent at
DM3.9bn.
Mr Jan Runau, a company spokesman, said turnover was no longer a priority.
Adidas was putting more emphasis on the higher margins attainable by moving
sportswear products up-market.
The company said it hoped to recover its former market position with several
new products, including a football shoe called Predator.
Although Adidas's market share in Germany, its most important market, fell 1
per cent, to 33 per cent, Mr Runau said there were signs sales were picking
up, following better results in the second half of 1993.
Nike, the American sportswear maker, is second in Germany with a 20 per cent
market share.
Extensive restructuring at the formerly family-owned company, based outside
Nuremberg, has seen the workforce fall 26 per cent to 5,096.
