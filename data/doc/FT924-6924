FT  19 NOV 92 / UK holds out on EC border controls
BRITAIN and the European Commission have 'not yet found common ground' on
the vexed political issue of lifting the UK's border controls on people,
according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, writes
Andrew Hill in Strasbourg.
He said yesterday the nine continental European members of the Schengen free
travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow EC visitors to
Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control after January
1 1993.
After meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, in September, Mr
Bangemann was widely understood to have agreed British compromise proposals.
But in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he said he had been
misinterpreted and discussions were continuing.
Britain has always argued that controls are essential if non-EC travellers
are to be properly monitored.
