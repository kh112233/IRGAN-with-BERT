FT  09 JAN 92 / Power chief makes concessions on price
MR JOHN BAKER, chief executive of National Power, yesterday offered an olive
branch to his opponents in the argument about electricity prices.
At a meeting of the Major Energy Users Council (Meuc), which has lobbied
fiercely for lower electricity prices, Mr Baker defended National Power's
pricing, but said that he recognised the problems that large consumers
faced.
He put forward specific proposals for keeping prices down:
Large consumers should refuse to subsidise coal through the electricity
price, and should be vigilant about the nuclear levy, which typically added
11 per cent to bills.
They should watch how much they were charged by regional electricity
companies for using electricity wires, since rates of return in that
business were far higher than anything generators earned.
They should also press for cuts in metering charges, which form a big chunk
of their bill. Mr Baker said it was important to deregulate the market as
quickly as possible, and to axe existing limits on how much power generators
could sell, so customers could shop around more, he said.
Consumers should also press for a more open market in electricity contracts,
he advised. Most electricity is sold on contract, but so far the pool or
wholesale market has been the focus of attention.
He said that customers should also think hard about why so many new
gas-fired power stations were being built, forcing out cheaper coal-fired
stations. Because these new stations have contracts which allow them to pass
costs on to captive domestic consumers, he implied, they can force out coal
stations, pushing up prices for larger consumers.
Mr Baker pointed out that most industrialists complained that high UK
electricity prices made them uncompetitive in Europe. If this was so, he
said, they should challenge subsidised European prices in Brussels.
'But I detect a note of reluctance from many of you who are recipients of
these prices in Europe,' he said.
