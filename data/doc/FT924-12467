FT  21 OCT 92 / EC tries to defuse Danube dispute
THE European Community has stepped in to avert confrontation between Hungary
and Slovakia over the damming of the river Danube. The move comes as
Slovakian constructors are poised to block and divert the Danube river into
the controversial Gabcikovo power plant against furious Hungarian
opposition.
The EC has invited Slovak and Hungarian negotiators to meet today in
Brussels to try to hammer out a compromise.
The EC's initiative in hosting last-minute talks put on hold Slovakia's plan
to begin damming the river yesterday but the delay represents only a stay of
execution and the chances for agreement remain slim. The EC environment
commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, had urged Slovakia to avoid taking an
irreversible step to complete the project before negotiations but made no
further intervention.
Both sides have painted themselves into a corner, with Budapest claiming
that the 40km diversion of the Danube, its northern border, would be an
environmental catastrophe and territorial violation. Slovakia's position is
equally hard, because of the economic cost of abandoning the project.
The dispute has become entangled with tensions over the 800,000 Hungarian
minority in Slovakia.
