FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham
Buckingham International, the hotels and property group, has suffered
another setback after the High Court made a Pounds 3.7m judgment against it.
The judgment arose out of the 1986 purchase of the World Wide Dryer
business. Buckingham is considering an appeal.
Buckingham, which reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 104m in the year to
October 31 after substantial write-downs on properties in the UK and
Portugal, is currently working through an asset disposal programme to reduce
its Pounds 92.9m debt.
