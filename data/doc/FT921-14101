FT  17 JAN 92 / Appointments: Eyeing a 'spectacular turnround'
CROWN COMMUNICATIONS which, on Wednesday, announced a Pounds 6.79m loss for
the year ending September 1991, has appointed a new finance director. David
Whitaker comes to the group which owns LBC radio from the cable and
telecommunications industry.
Whitaker, 42, replaces Ian Stevenson, who is returning to Edinburgh to run
his own accountancy firm, but who remains a non-executive director. Crown
says that the latter's departure was unconnected with the poor 1991 results;
originally appointed for just a year to see the company through a difficult
patch, he had stayed for more than two and had made clear his intentions of
going some six months ago. Crown had then appointed another finance director
but he died suddenly, at the age of 40.
Whitaker was part of the cable tv revolution at its inception in 1984, first
with Windsor TV, then with Cable Communications, now owned by Southwestern
Bell; for the past year he has worked as a consultant to foreign companies
interested in breaking into UK telecommunications. While he acknowledges the
challenge of his assignment, he reckons that 'given the right conditions,
the turnround (at Crown) could be quite spectacular'.
At the same time, chief executive David Haynes, a New Zealander who has
spent a large part of his working life in Australia, has promoted Australian
Peter Benson to the position of group director. Benson joined Crown in July
1991 as group general manager; he had come from Sky Television where, as
general manager, he had been involved in its launch.
