FT  10 MAY 91 / Recovery in tourism is expected
TOURIST arrivals to the UK in 1991 are forecast to recover sharply after the
steep decline earlier this year caused by the Gulf war.
The British Tourist Authority said incoming tourist numbers had already
increased significantly after falling 18 per cent in the first two months of
this year from the levels of the corresponding period of 1990.
It forecast 18m overseas visitors to the UK this year, marginally ahead of
the record 17.9m last year, with their expenditure reaching Pounds 7.8bn
against Pounds 7.7bn last year.
'Tourism is a resilient industry and it is already bouncing back,' Mr
William Davis, chairman of the BTA, told a London conference yesterday.
The BTA says the recovery is driven by increased numbers of tourists from
western Europe, especially the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Numbers from
the US are also recovering but the Japanese and Far East market is taking
longer to pick up. Mr Davis forecast there could be more than than 22m
overseas visitors to the UK by 1995.
