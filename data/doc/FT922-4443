FT  05 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A SUCCESSFUL bond auction in Paris helped to reverse falls in stock index
futures which had seen the contract fall to trade at a discount to the cash
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The negative sentiment overhanging the June contract on the FT-SE on
Wednesday continued in the early part of yesterday's session and the
contract opened at an 8-point discount to the cash market, at 2,672.
Continued falls in the gilts and currency market only served to bring out
more sellers. June had fallen to 2,657 within an hour and a half of the
market's opening.
A feeling that the contract had been oversold, however, started to take hold
mid-morning. This helped to steady June, preventing further falls before the
news from Paris floated through to the London markets to help June not only
regain lost ground but surge beyond its opening level.
Dealers reported sizeable spread trading - aggressive buying of June and
selling of September. June closed at 2,687, up 7 and at around its fair
value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover at 10,019 was again good.
Traded options turnover reached 26,353 lots with the FT-SE option trading
10,723 contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,459 lots
with the November 240 calls the busiest series.
