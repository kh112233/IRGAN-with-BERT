FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Match point
The apparent end of the long search for Gatt's next director-general is bad
news for Julio Lacarte-Muro, Uruguay's 75-year-old chief trade negotiator.
Despite his age, he had thrown his cap in the ring and, given that Peter
Sutherland is almost 30 years younger, it looks likely that Lacarte-Muro
will never perform the job he seemed made for.
The spry Uruguayan, who plays tennis four times a week and shows no sign of
slowing down, beats the competition hands down in terms of Gatt experience.
He was in on the negotiations which established Gatt in 1947, becoming
deputy executive secretary of the organisation at its inception.
During three tours of duty as Uruguay's Gatt ambassador in Geneva, he has
been chairman of Gatt's governing council and of the contracting parties
(members). He has taken part in all eight trade liberalising Gatt rounds,
and, of course, was instrumental in persuading Gatt members to choose Punta
del Este - the fashionable seaside resort where he has a holiday home - to
launch the present Uruguay Round in 1986.
In or out of the top job, Lacarte-Muro has a long-standing personal interest
in one aspect of the current weary round - the proposed creation of a
powerful Multilateral Trade Organisation. An International Trade
Organisation was the centrepiece of the 1948 Havana Charter which
Lacarte-Muro helped draw up, only to see it vetoed by the US Congress.
