FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Moody's cuts debt rating for GPA Group
GPA Group, the Irish aircraft leasing company struggling to restructure its
finances, suffered a further blow to confidence when Moody's rating agency
cut its debt rating from Ba2 to B1.
Moody's said the cut reflected uncertainty over the outcome of restructuring
and the depressed condition of the airline industry. The Dollars 1.8bn in
debt affected had already fallen below investment grade.
