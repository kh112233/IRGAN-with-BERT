FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: GWR shares rise after settlement
Shares in Great Western Resources, the oil and gas concern, jumped 4p to 26p
yesterday on news of provisional settlement to a dispute which had
threatened its survival.
Coal subsidiaries have settled all litigation and disputes with South
Carolina Public Service Authority, better known as Santee Cooper, about coal
contracts.
Great Western and Santee Cooper have agreed to enter into new agreements and
GW will receive Dollars 33m of payments owed but witheld by Santee.
The provisional settlement is conditional on the coal subsidiaries,
currently in chapter 11, emerging from bankruptcy. Great Western is
therefore trying to renegotiate Dollars 82m of borrowings.
