FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: The politics of union fails to
cross big divide
THE MESSAGE from Denmark that was resounding around the European Community
yesterday was that governments cannot necessarily deliver what they sign up
to with their partners.
The first high-level EC conclave to discuss the fall-out - a solemn, closed
session of the European Commission yesterday morning - was under no
illusions.
'It will take very careful and skilful management to get Maastricht adopted,
to keep going,' said one senior Commission official after the meeting.
There are genuine fears in Brussels that the Maastricht treaty could unravel
as the ratification process goes on throughout the rest of the Community.
The greatest concern is that national parliaments will begin to pick away at
the treaty's political union objectives, in some cases because they are too
ambitious, but in more instances because they do not go far enough.
The treaty extends and widens the EC's law-making competence, envisages
greater use of majority voting (thereby weakening national vetoes), and
gives the directly elected European Parliament greater legislative and
scrutiny powers. It gives the future European Union a common foreign policy
and defence dimension, and foresees greater co-operation on justice matters,
ranging from immigration to terrorism.
UK objections to Maastricht's original social policy ambitions led to its 11
partners making separate provisions for more advanced laws through a
protocol to the treaty. And in what should become a move towards more
federal fiscal arrangements, Spain and the southern countries won agreement
for greater transfers from the richer countries.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds
the EC presidency, insisted yesterday: 'There is no room for renegotiation'
of the treaty. 'There is strong unanimity that the 11 should go ahead
without any hesitation to fulfil the objectives they set out,' he added, a
view confirmed by governments in virtually all national capitals. Mr Jacques
Delors, Commission president, read a statement calling for ratification of
the treaty to go ahead as planned, 'in order to achieve the general
objectives adopted at Maastricht'.
The Commission strategy appeared to be to urge rapid assent in the rest of
the EC and then try to get a deal with the Danes. Delay risks the leakage of
Danish Euro-scepticism into other countries.
In Germany, there is widespread angst that the D-Mark will be surrendered
for a less solid single currency within monetary union, but equal concern
that there is not enough democratic accountability in the treaty to
compensate the transfer of sovereignty. In France there is concern both
about sovereignty and the treaty's granting of the vote to foreigners in
municipal and European elections. UK officials say they remain satisfied
they got a good treaty at Maastricht, but fear the Danish outcome could fan
the embers of Euro-scepticism in the Tory Party.
The Dutch, Belgians and Italians all demanded more powers for the European
Parliament. 'Some of our MPs will say: 'why not now push our governments to
make this or that amendment?',' a Dutch diplomat said.
In Ireland, a 'yes' vote in this month's referendum would safeguard only an
unamended treaty. Any change might risk a new referendum, and provoke
collision with the abortion plebiscite later in the year. The southern
countries, Spain, Portugal and Greece, are solidly behind the treaty, but
only if it delivers the extra cash it promises but does not detail.
That detail is contained in the 'Delors II' five-year finance package for
1993-97, which forsees a 30 per cent increase in EC revenue. The package is
stalled by opposition, led by Germany and the UK. A settlement was expected
at December's Edinburgh summit under the UK presidency, but the Danish
imbroglio now makes that deadline doubtful.
Legally viable solutions to the crisis were being mooted yesterday, starting
from the bottom line that the treaty as currently writ requires 12 votes to
come into effect. One possibility was that all 12 'denounce' the existing
Treaty of Rome, for all except Denmark then to embrace Maastricht, leaving
the Danes to decide whether to reaffirm the Rome Treaty or withdraw to the
European Economic Area. This treaty comes into effect next year and spreads
the EC single market to Denmark's former colleagues in the European Free
Trade Association.
