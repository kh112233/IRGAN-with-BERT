FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers put in the picture
Japanese electronics company NEC has developed a computer system that can
identify famous pictures from rough sketches drawn on the screen.
The Intellectual Image Search System uses pattern recognition technology to
analyse the colour and composition of a sketch and matches it with the most
appropriate image in its database.
As well as innumerable multimedia uses in education, NEC predicts that the
system could be used to catch criminals by matching rough sketches drawn by
witnesses to images on a police database. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6511.
