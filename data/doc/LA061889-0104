THE WORLD 
Jose Antonio Zorrilla, once head of Mexico's now-defunct Federal Security 
Directorate, was indicted for murder in the 1984 slaying of journalist Manuel 
Buendia. Prosecutors contend that Zorrilla, 47, masterminded the killing of the 
influential Excelsior newspaper columnist, who was shot in the back in a Mexico 
City parking lot on May 30, 1984. In presenting its case, the prosecution said 
Buendia was slain because Zorrilla feared the journalist would expose links to 
some of Mexico's major drug traffickers. Zorrilla, who has denied having any 
role in the murder, did not enter a plea at the hearing. At the same time, an 
arrest warrant was issued for Buendia's alleged assassin, but authorities 
refused to disclose the identity of the suspect.
