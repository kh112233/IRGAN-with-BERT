FT  13 MAY 94 / Spratly oil contract irks China
China yesterday denounced Vietnam's contract with US oil company Mobil as a
violation of Beijing's sovereignty in the South China Sea, but has pledged
to settle all disputes peacefully, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The foreign ministry reiterated Beijing's claim to the entire area around
the Spratly Islands, including an area where Mobil has said it would press
on with offshore oil exploration work.
'China possesses irrevocable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and the
adjacent waters,' Mr Wu Jianmin said, using China's name for the disputed
group.
He said the Blue Dragon plot where Mobil wants to explore comes into the
area of China's control in the waters 'adjacent' to the Spratlys. Vietnam
says the plot is part of its continental shelf.
The offshore row heated up last month when Crestone Energy of Denver said it
had begun seismic surveys in an area immediately east of the Blue Dragon
field. Beijing awarded the contract to Crestone in 1992.
