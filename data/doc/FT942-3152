FT  16 JUN 94 / Women-only shortlists opposed
The GMB general union conference voted yesterday to oppose the Labour
party's new rules that require women-only shortlists in the selection of
parliamentary candidates for the next general election.
This means the controversial rule passed last year will be debated at this
autumn's party conference.
Labour is committed to ensure that half its parliamentary candidates in both
winnable and vacant constituencies are women.
