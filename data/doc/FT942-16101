FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Greenacre's rise to Pounds 1.7m helped by
purchases
In a year in which its operations 'grew significantly' Greenacre, the
USM-traded nursing home operator, reported profits up by a quarter and
announced a 20 per cent increase in its annual dividend.
On turnover up from Pounds 4.82m to Pounds 7.44m, pre-tax profits for the
year to end-January grew by Pounds 342,500 to Pounds 1.7m. The proposed
final dividend of 0.18p raises the total to 0.33p (0.28p) - covered more
than twice by earnings of 0.72p (0.57p).
The advance was boosted by acquisitions, which added Pounds 1.04m to
turnover and Pounds 369,958 to operating profit.
Almost 170 beds were added during the period - the company now operates 12
homes with a total of 578 beds.
During the year further mortgage borrowings were contracted to finance
development and acquisitions and net borrowings at the year-end were Pounds
4.24m, giving gearing of 31 per cent.
