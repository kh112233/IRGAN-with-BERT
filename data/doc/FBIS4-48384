  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 18 May (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels have 
turned their attention away from the capital Kigali and are 
advancing toward a town to the southwest where the government 
fled last month, United Nations officials said Wednesday [18 
May]. Sporadic mortar blasts and small arms fire rocked the 
blood-sodden capital Wednesday as guerrillas of the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) fought government soldiers. But it was 
"relatively quiet" compared to recent fierce artillery battles, 
said Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). "Taking Kigali is not for the time 
being the RPF's number one objective," Kabia told AFP by 
telephone from Kigali. 
  Heavy fighting raged in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri 
where the Army is holding out against a rebel onslaught, and 
south of Kigali where the RPF have cut off the government from 
the capital. The rebels have seized control of a stretch of road 
between Kigali and Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the 
southwest, where the interim government fled as ethnic killings 
and fighting between government and rebel forces engulfed the 
capital, Kabia said. His report, however, was denied by an Army 
spokesman who said government forces controlled the road between 
Gitarama and Kigali. [passage omitted] 
  The rebels have sealed off the capital on three sides. They 
are trying to sever Army supply lines and isolate the government 
from its forces and possibly force them to flee a second time, 
UN military sources said.
