FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Save &amp; Prosper
SAVE &amp; Prosper is offering a 1 per cent discount on the charges on three of
its Asian unit trusts for investments made before December 3 1993. The usual
initial charge is 5.5 per cent.
The South East Asia Growth fund, which has been going since 1978, invests in
the markets of the Far East, excluding Japan. Its performance was 10th of 28
funds in its sector over the five years to November 1, with growth of 270
per cent (offer to bid, income re-invested, source: Hardwick Stafford
Wright). Over three years, it was ranked 24th of 45 funds, and it was 15th
out of 49 funds over the past year, growing 55 per cent.
The Asian Smaller Companies fund was launched in August 1993 and is invested
mainly in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The China Dragon fund was
launched in February 1993 and invests in China and adjoining territories
such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Both these funds are too new to have a
reliable track record.
