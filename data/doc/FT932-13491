FT  23 APR 93 / Bhutto's husband appointed
THE political comeback of Ms Benazir Bhutto, dismissed as Pakistan's prime
minister in 1990, gathered pace yesterday with the appointment of her
husband, Mr Asif Ali Zardari, as a minister in the interim government.
After Ms Bhutto's government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Mr
Zardari spent over two years in prison. He has been acquitted on nine of 12
cases filed against him, including murder.
In February, following reports of meetings between aides of Ms Bhutto and
the president, Mr Zardari was released on bail though he still faced charges
of extortion, illegal possession of arms and fixing of bank loans.
On Sunday, Mr Khan dismissed the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, Ms Bhutto's
successor, who had sought to strip the president of his powers to remove
governments and appoint the chiefs of the armed services. The president
called elections for July.
The appointment of Mr Zardari, one of four ministers in the new government
from Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party is a further sign of a
rapprochement between Ms Bhutto and the president as part of a rapid
shifting of political alliances within Pakistan.
As opposition leader, Ms Bhutto repeatedly accused the president of
supporting a campaign to victimise her supporters, including the laying of
false criminal charges. However, she moved swiftly to take advantage of the
constitutional dispute between Mr Khan and Mr Sharif, declining to use her
party's votes to back Mr Sharif.
Mr Zardari is one of 17 new ministers in the caretaker government. Finance
minister Mr Farooq Leghari, deputy leader of the PPP, and planning minister
Mr Hamid Nasir Chattha, were sworn in on Sunday along with Mr Balkh Sher
Mazari, the interim prime minister.
Other ministers include seven from factions of the Pakistan Muslim League,
the main party in Mr Sharif's coalition.
