FT  30 JUN 94 / Observer: Hemmed in
The onward march of female feet along the House of Commons corridors of
power continues. Following in the steps of Betty Boothroyd, the first woman
Speaker, the Rev Phyllis Bates yesterday became the first woman to lead the
traditional prayers
held at the beginning of every
sitting.
The irony was heightened by the presence on the front bench of John Gummer,
the environment secretary and former member of the Church of England general
synod, who recently converted to Roman Catholicism because of his opposition
to women priests.
