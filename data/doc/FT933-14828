FT  13 JUL 93 / Opel leak shocks motor industry
MOTOR industry executives yesterday expressed surprise at the German
announcement that plans for Opel's top-secret model had been found in a flat
in Wiesbaden, saying theirs was an industry that was generally free of
industrial espionage.
They said manufacturers searching for ways of increasing competitiveness
normally had relatively little difficulty keeping them in-house thanks to
the industry's 'confidentiality clause' contract system.
Engineers, senior managers and others with access at an early stage to new
model programmes, investment and technology strategies have these clauses
written into their contracts - and few have been known to abuse them.
'The reason is fairly obvious in the case of anyone whose career is in the
industry,' one UK motor industry executive who wished to remain anonymous
said last night.
'There might be a short-term gain for someone moving confidential
information from one company to another. But in the long-term? What does
that engineer or executive do if he or she wants or needs to make another
move? The word would have got around about what had happened. Put simply,
there would be nowhere else in the industry for that person to go.'
The system has also survived substantial change in the organisation and
processes of the industry which have meant that many more people than even
five years ago necessarily have knowledge of key projects and strategies at
an early stage.
'The days when a car maker's board had all the good ideas and took decisions
behind closed doors has gone,' said another.
'If it's a significant project, it will involve the use of a centralised
computer database and require information and input at an early stage from
people in middle management, engineers and similar.'
