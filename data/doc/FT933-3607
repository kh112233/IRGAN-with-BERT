FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ecuador's reforestation project still
commands strong support
Sir, Your article, 'When conservation efforts fail to protect' (September
1), does a good job of describing the rapid destruction of the tropical rain
forest of Ecuador, but fails to do justice to what could be a model
reforestation project - Ecoforest 2000.
There are two factual discrepancies in the article. First, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) has not withdrawn from the project. Rather, IFC
will not finance the project until it has attained assurances that the
environmental and social issues that have been raised are addressed. Second,
the project has not collapsed. The Durini Group (the company) is continuing
to establish plantations to reduce its dependency on primary forest wood
sources, although without external financing, progress will proceed at a
much slower pace.
At a public forum held in Quito in April 1993, results of an independent
review of the biodiversity and social impact aspects of the project were
presented. The meeting provided an opportunity for a broad spectrum of local
and international non-governmental organisations and representatives of the
affected indige nous and ethnic minority communities to present their views
on the project. Subsequent correspondence from the participants and other
interested parties, with few exceptions, has been supportive to the project,
assuming implementation of the recommendations of the independent review.
IFC remains convinced of the merits of the project. Ecoforest 2000 will
result in the reforestation of 5,000 hectares of degraded land, provide a
long-term sustainable supply of wood, and eventually eliminate the company's
logging in primary tropical rainforest.
