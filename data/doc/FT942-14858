FT  19 APR 94 / EU to pay for cremation probe
A Netherlands crematorium has been chosen to co-ordinate an EU-subsidised
investigation into the environmental effects of cremation. Ms Romea Fenster,
head of Amsterdam's Westgaarde burial ground and crematorium, said that the
study will focus on the impact of strewing ashes and of gases released
during cremation. The European Union is providing half the project's
Ecu350,000 (Pounds 269,000) cost. The study, by crematoria in the
Netherlands and Italy, may lead to EU guidelines, Ms Fenster said. 'We
should be thinking about it now or it could become a problem,' she said.
Nearly half the Dutch dead are cremated, compared with about 70 per cent of
Britons.
