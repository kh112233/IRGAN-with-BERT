FT  28 JAN 94 / Fraud charge total rises
The amount involved in fraud charges rose 11 per cent to Pounds 704m last
year, according to figures released yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm.
The KPMG 'fraud barometer' showed a rise from Pounds 637m in 1992, although
fraud cases fell from 83 to 53. The increase reflects charges of false
accounting for more than Pounds 480m against Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former head
of treasury in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The
amount of the next largest charge was almost a tenth of this.
The fraud barometer is based on reported cases of criminal fraud with
charges in excess of Pounds 100,000 brought in a UK court.
