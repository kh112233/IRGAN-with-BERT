FT  29 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Platinum takes a cue from
gold
SOME OF the froth from the gold rally has blown over into the platinum
market this week.
Yesterday on the London bullion market platinum at one stage traded above
Dollars 400 a troy ounce, before finishing at Dollars 396.75, up Dollars
6.50 on the day and Dollars 12 on the week and the highest level for more
than two years.
This left platinum at a premium to gold of Dollars 17 a troy ounce, compared
with only Dollars 9.60 at the end of last week.
'The widening of the platinum to gold spread to around Dollars 20 was
confirmation that it was safe to keep buying gold at the current levels,'
said Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland. He added that
the weakness of the US dollar against the yen had encouraged the market to
believe that the Japanese would seize the opportunity to buy platinum.
The gold price has been led this week by New York's Comex, where fund and
option activity has kept things on the boil. In London yesterday the price
retreated from the day's high of Dollars 383.50 a troy ounce after US funds
liquidated long positions ahead of the holiday weekend.
Gold closed at Dollars 379.75 a troy ounce, Dollars 3.05 up on the day and
Dollars 4.60 on the week after a jittery few days.
Mr Smith pointed out that at current levels Hong Kong gold, normally at a
premium of 50 cents to Dollars 1 to London, had moved to a discount,
reflecting weaker demand in the Far East.
However, GNI, the London futures broker, says in its June futures and
options briefing that a tight physical market has made gold ultra-sensitive
to any pick-up in investment demand. In three of the past four years the
mined supply of gold has fallen short of fabrication demand.
Western investors have piled into gold because they believe they have little
to lose, GNI says. Gold's perceived floor at Dollars 330 a troy ounce
provided limited risk on the downside, while low interest rates in nominal
and real terms was minimising the income foregone from investing in precious
metals.
On the London Metal Exchange copper has been volatile, but with good volume
and good two-way interest driving the moves. On Monday three-month metal
bounced off Dollars 1,820 a tonne, leading to an attempt on Tuesday on
resistance at Dollars 1,850. But profit taking took prices back down on
Wednesday, and on Thursday the price was back below Dollars 1,800.
Mr William Adams, analyst with Rudolf Wolff, said copper was trading in a
broad range between a recent low of Dollars 1,705 on May 7, and Dollars
1,885 on May 13. It needed to remain above Dollars 1,760 for a further
attempt on the upside.
The continuing increase in LME warehouse stocks is keeping the market under
pressure. Copper stocks rose by 725 tonnes on Monday and a further 6,000
tonnes on Thursday and now stand at a record 420,400 tonnes.
Yesterday three-month copper closed at Dollars 1,795 a tonne. Cash copper -
still traded in sterling on the LME - closed at Pounds 1,146.50 a tonne,
down Pounds 37.50 on the week.
The pressure on copper has spilled over to most of the other base metals,
although lead and aluminium have been steadier.
Lead, which was at a 6 3/4 -year low last week, was boosted on Monday by
news that Metaleurop was stopping production at smelters in France and
Germany between June 15 and August 15, cutting refined output by 50,000
tonnes. Prices moved sharply ahead, but have since drifted lower. Cash lead
closed at Pounds 258.50 a tonne yesterday, up Pounds 2.75 in the week.
The aluminium market is keeping a close eye on negotiations at Reynolds and
Alcoa, where labour contracts expire at the end of the month and the unions
have a mandate for strike action. Cash aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars
1,128 a tonne, just Dollars 8 up on the week.
Tin prices, already on a downward path, were not helped by Malaysian
suggestions that the quota system of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries was not worth maintaining. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's primary
industries minister, said on Thursday that prices could not be any worse
than present levels even if the quota system was abandoned. Cash tin closed
at Dollars 5,303.50 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 146.50 on the week.
The failure of the International Coffee Organisation in March to renegotiate
an agreement has kept world prices near historic lows. This week producing
countries started to take matters into their own hands.
Late on Monday Brazil and Colombia, the two largest producers, agreed to
freeze stocks and limit exports respectively to 17m bags and 13m bags (60
kgs each). At the same time Central American producers - Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala - agreed to withhold 15 per cent of
their production for 1993-94.
Together these countries account for about 60 per cent of world coffee
production. They look set to form a Latin American alliance which other
countries could join. Ecuador has already shown interest, and the
Inter-African Coffee Organisation has expressed strong support.
However, the markets appear more concerned with the high level of consumer
stocks, which some estimates put as high as 20m bags. The London July
robusta coffee contract closed yesterday at Dollars 920 a tonne, down
Dollars 27 on the week.
