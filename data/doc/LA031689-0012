SCIENTISTS AND FOOD COMPANIES ARE CONSTANTLY DEBATING HEALTH CLAIMS 
In the last four years, the health-claims issue has generated a constant debate 
between science and business. Scientists worry about food companies' getting 
into the health business and marketers worry about health experts' getting into 
the food business. 
At the heart of the controversy is the extent to which the government should 
get involved. Here's what's happened so far: 
October 1984: Kellogg's breaks an 82-year prohibition against advertising 
health claims on food labels by launching a national ad campaign for its 
All-Bran cereal. The promotion, based on the value of high-fiber diets in 
reducing the risks of certain forms of cancer, is particularly controversial 
because the National Cancer Institute, a government agency, helped devise it. 
August 1987: The Food and Drug Administration proposes allowing health claims 
on food labels. The plan is vague and ambiguous, giving food companies a lot of 
latitude. While it's pending, the proposal permits manufacturers to make 
claims. 
December, 1987: Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Government 
Operations subcommittee that oversees FDA, charges that the agency's proposal 
had been watered down by political appointees in the Office of Management and 
Budget, where the document was reviewed before its release. Weiss says that the 
proposal "strongly reflects the intervention of OMB ideologues who seek 
unregulated market entry of food products bearing disease-specific health 
claims." 
January, 1988: Public comment on the proposal ends. The majority of comments 
oppose it or parts of it. 
September, 1988: FDA reviews the comments and sends an amended, more 
restrictive final rule to OMB. OMB receives an indefinite extension to respond. 
December, 1988: Manufacturers continue to make health claims on food labels.
