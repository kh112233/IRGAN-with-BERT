FT  20 APR 94 / Surge in part-time work hits tax take
The Treasury is losing as much as Pounds 700m a year in tax revenues as a
result of the switch from full-time to part-time jobs in the labour market,
according to figures published today by the Trades Union Congress.
The fall in the number of registered unemployed during the past 12 months
has been caused by the creation of part-time jobs - 200,000 in the year to
the autumn of 1993. But part-time workers pay far less in tax and National
Insurance contributions than those in full-time jobs.
The TUC said a part-time worker earned an average of Pounds 80 a week but
would pay no more than Pounds 320 a year in tax and National Insurance,
whereas a full-time worker on an average weekly wage of Pounds 300 would pay
about Pounds 3,900.
'The difference between the revenue produced by 200,000 part-time jobs and
the same number of full-time jobs would be equivalent to a penny on the
standard rate of income tax,' the TUC said.
'These figures suggest the revenue gain from each full-time job is at least
10 times greater than a part-time job,' added Mr John Monks, TUC general
secretary. 'The switch to part-time working has big implications not only
for workers and employers but also for the government.'
