FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: Brushing away gum disease - Worth Watching
Sufferers from periodontal (gum) disease, which afflicts nearly 80 per cent
of Americans, may some day have a novel way to relieve their symptoms,
writes Karen Zagor.
Sepracor, a Massachusetts biotechnology company, has received a patent
covering toothpaste and mouthwash formulations of two drugs which reduce
inflammation and bone loss.
The two substances, S-ketoprofen and S-flurbiprofen, both of which are
single isomer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are already on the
market as analgesics in 'racemic' form - a mixture of two mirror-image
chemical molecules.
Sepracor believes that its single isomer technology will create drugs which
are purer and should also be cheaper to manufacture. Sepracor: US, 508
