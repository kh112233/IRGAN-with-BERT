FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): No improvement seen in reading
standards
READING standards in primary schools in England and Wales have failed to
improve in the past year in spite of last year's national tests for
seven-year-olds, according Her Majesty's Inspectorate.
Reading standards were found to be poor in about 20 per cent of schools and
good in 37 per cent. The inspectorate concluded in its report, published
yesterday, that: 'Poor standards were strongly associated with weakness in
the quality of teaching and in the organisation and management of work in
the classroom.'
The report will fuel the debate about teaching methods in primary schools. A
government report in January called for greater emphasis on formal
instruction.
The inspectorate broadly confirms the results of last year's tests, which
found that 28 per cent of pupils had not reached the reading standards set
for their age group. It notes that the tests themselves have improved the
assessment of reading standards.
The report said that teachers felt 'poorly equipped' for the task of
teaching children with serious reading difficulties.
The report also noted the importance of the home environment, saying: 'The
positive influence of parents was strongly evident in the performance of
many of those children who were competent readers at an early stage.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has asked chairmen of local
education authorities to take 'an active and critical interest' in raising
reading standards.
