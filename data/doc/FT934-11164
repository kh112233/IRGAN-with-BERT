FT  02 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Bradford &amp; Bingley
The rules on German mortgage lending look so advantageous to lenders that
one is surprised that Bradford &amp; Bingley is the first building society to
open a Bausparkasse there. Not only does Bausparkasse lending carry a
guaranteed margin of 2 per cent. The minimum loan-to-value ratio of 80 per
cent means the risk of bad debts is smaller than in the UK where B&amp;B is
currently lending up to 95 per cent of a property's value. Besides,
Bausparkasse borrowers must save with the institution for at least 18 months
before taking out a loan.
Nothing comes without a price, of course. B&amp;B has jumped the first hurdle of
obtaining its licence. Now comes the struggle to acquire a share of a market
which is pretty well stitched up by established operators. B&amp;B reckons its
German operation can become profitable on the basis of a 1 per cent market
share. That, though, would hardly constitute a meaningful diversification
for Britain's seventh largest building society. Yet B&amp;B deserves applause
for having latched on to the long-term opportunities in a market that is
opening up, particularly to insurance products. Exploiting these
opportunities will require patience, but quick-fix efforts at
diversification can easily end in tears, as Abbey National's humiliating
foray into French commercial lending shows.
