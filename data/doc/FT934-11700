FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
STOCK index futures challenged the 3,200 level after a strong advance on
Wall Street which brought a sharp turnround in what had otherwise been a
dull derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Sporadic selling followed what had been a fairly subdued opening for the
December contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,174. That selling soon developed
into more general profit-taking which drove the contract lower.
An early attempt at a rally ran out of steam when US houses turned sellers
of the contract after the release of US GDP figures. Some had expected the
figure to be higher than the 2.8 per cent increase it recorded and December
fell to the day's low of 3160.
However, the strong recovery in US bonds that brought a better than expected
opening on Wall Street enticed buyers in London causing a reversal in
December's fortunes. It advanced to the day's high of 3,196 in the last hour
of trading before a bout of profit taking in the dying minutes saw it finish
below its peak.
December finished at 3,185, around 5 points ahead of its estimated fair
value premium to cash of 15. Volume was 9,230.
Traded options had a less active session and volume slipped back to 37,470
contracts. However, turnover in the FT-SE 100 option improved at 10,572.
Wellcome was the most active stock option after disappointing figures.
