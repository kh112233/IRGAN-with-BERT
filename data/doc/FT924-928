FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: CBOT members reject new trading facility
MEMBERS of the Chicago Board of Trade have defeated a plan to build a
trading facility on property adjacent to the LaSalle Street futures
exchange.
Exchange members have said the Dollars 150m proposal was too costly,
considering the declining profitability of small member firms. But exchange
officials said the rapid growth of CBOT financial futures products would be
stifled if the trading floor was not expanded.
Mr William O'Connor, CBOT chairman said: 'This vote means that our members
want the leadership of this exchange to explore other means of developing a
new trading facility, and that is what we will do.'
Mr O'Connor will leave his post as chairman in January.
Air Canada would post a loss of about CDollars 300m (USDollars 234.3m) for
1992 after restructuring charges, and 1993 will again be turbulent, Mr
Hollis Harris, president, predicted, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
In 1992 Air Canada lost CDollars 218m, as it began a fare war with its rival
Canadian Airlines, owned by PWA in Calgary. Both airlines have been ordered
by the federal government to reduce capacity and cease the damaging fare
war.
Air Canada is trying to complete a joint venture takeover of Continental
Airlines in the US and marketing agreements with United Airlines and Air
France, while PWA is negotiating a marketing and financial deal with
American Airlines.
