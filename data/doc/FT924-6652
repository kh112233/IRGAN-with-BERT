FT  20 NOV 92 / Former Bishop of London plans move to Roman Catholic church
in protest at vote for women priests
GRAHAM LEONARD, former bishop of London, is planning to join the Roman
Catholic Church in protest at last week's vote in favour of the ordination
of women priests.
The bishop, third most senior in the Anglican hierarchy until he retired
last year, suggested in an article in the Catholic Herald that a breakaway
church might be formed under the authority of the Pope.
The archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, yesterday called for
'ill-considered judgments' to be avoided.
