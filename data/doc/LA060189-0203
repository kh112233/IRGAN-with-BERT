MERCY DEATH FATHER HOSPITALIZED 
Rudy Linares, the distraught father who disconnected his comatose son's 
life-support system at gunpoint, was hospitalized early today after a drug 
overdose, officials said. 
Cicero Police Deputy Supt. Steven Zalas said Linares, 23, told police he had 
taken some bad PCP "and he wanted his money back from the guy he bought it 
from." Linares refused to tell police who had sold him the drug "because then 
he can't buy it any more," Zalas added. 
When police asked him why he had taken the drug, Zalas said Linares responded, 
"What would you do if your son just died?" 
The overdose comes about two weeks after a grand jury declined to indict 
Linares on a murder charge in the death of his 15-month-old son, Samuel. The 
boy had been comatose nearly nine months after a freak accident in which he 
inhaled part of a balloon.
