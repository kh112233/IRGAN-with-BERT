FT  19 FEB 92 / Brussels to revise food label plans
THE European Commission is rethinking its approach to the regulation of
claims on food and drink labels, following strong lobbying by the food and
advertising industries, writes Guy de Jonquieres, Consumer Industries
Editor.
It had originally sought to curb false or misleading claims by drawing up
detailed lists of banned or restricted terms. However, food manufacturers
protested that such an approach would unduly inhibit marketing and product
innovation.
The Commission is now considering instead drawing up a set of general
principles, which would leave manufacturers free to make claims for their
products, provided they were able to prove these were justified.
Products could continue to be labelled with claims such as 'light',
'alcohol-free' or 'cholesterol-free' so long as manufacturers made clear
what they meant by these terms.
Brussels officials expect draft legislation to be submitted this year to the
Council of Ministers, which first asked the Commission in 1978 to propose a
system for regulating labelling claims.
