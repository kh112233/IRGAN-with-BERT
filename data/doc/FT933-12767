FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: National Express buys East Midlands Airport
NATIONAL EXPRESS, the motor coach services group, is expanding into airport
management with the acquisition for Pounds 27.1m of East Midlands
International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire.
The purchase marks the first privatisation of a leading regional airport.
East Midlands is the fourth largest in the UK.
Last month National Express emerged as the leading bidder of four contenders
for the airport, and has since been negotiating the price with accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick, which acted for the local authority owners.
National Express is funding Pounds 3.75m of the consideration through a
placing of 1.8m new shares, which represent about 5 per cent of the capital,
at 210p a share. Yesterday the shares moved up 8p to 223p.
The issue has been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell; Smith New Court
Corporate Finance are brokers.
However, the bulk of funding comes from the group's own cash holdings
(Pounds 5.8m) and from Pounds 17.5m of medium-term bank debt. This borrowing
means the group is taking on gearing which, by the end of this year, should
be 50 per cent.
The airport's net asset value is Pounds 10.3m higher than the purchase price
at Pounds 37.4m and it is generating cash. In the year to last March its
pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.36m on turnover of Pounds 17.8m, from
Pounds 2.48m on turnover of Pounds 15.8m.
As an investment the airport stands alone. Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief
executive, said that any capital expenditure until about the end of the
century could be funded internally. 'The airport has the resources to do
most things it wants to do in the foreseeable future.'
National Express takes over the airport from the Derbyshire, Leicestershire
and Nottinghamshire County Councils and the Nottingham City Council. The
other contenders to buy it were a management buy-out team, Lockheed, the US
group, and Regional Airports, a privately-owned UK company.
