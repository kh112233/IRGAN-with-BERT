FT  21 APR 94 / Mexican recovery put at risk as rates rise
Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, further endangering chances
of an economic recovery before August's presidential election. The rise did
not prevent a further weakening in the peso.
Interest rates on 28-day government paper rose to 18 per cent, 3.4
percentage points up on last week and compared with 8.8 per cent at the end
of February. Real interest rates are now about 11 per cent.
The rise in rates also led yesterday to another drop in Mexico's stock
market, which plunged 5.2 per cent to close at 1,957. The government allowed
rates to rise in an effort to prop up the peso, which has been hit by heavy
selling of Mexican securities provoked by the increase in US interest rates
and political turmoil that followed the assassination of presidential
candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio.
The peso is trading at 3.37 to the dollar, the central bank limit.
The rate rise threatens to choke economic growth in advance of the
presidential and congressional elections. Mexico had negative growth in the
last two quarters of last year and little growth is likely in the first half
of this year.
However, the government evidently believes a devaluation of the peso out of
its trading band against the dollar would be more costly than low economic
growth.
For the moment, it seems willing to let interest rates rise to the levels
necessary to defend the peso.
Mr Miguel Mancera, head of Mexico's independent central bank, said in an
interview last week: 'Probably we could have interest rates lower for some
time, but this would be an artificially low level, unsustainable, and in the
long run would produce more problems, more inflation, and probably a more
difficult situation in the exchange rate market.'
