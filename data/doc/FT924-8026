FT  13 NOV 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Chinese way to sounder sleep
Chinese medical techniques have once again come to the aid of western
patients with a pair of disposable, plastic mini cones to help insomniacs
sleep.
The Isocones are stuck by adhesive plaster to an acupuncture point on the
inside of each wrist. Find the correct spot, say distributors Sea-Band, and
golden slumbers ensue. Sea-Band: UK, 0445 251 007.
