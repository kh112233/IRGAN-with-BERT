FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Exports give Fujisawa pre-tax
rise
FUJISAWA Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, reported a firm
rise in interim pre-tax profits, thanks to improvements in its financial
balance.
The company said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months
to September rose 15.8 per cent to Y10.87bn (Dollars 88.3m) from Y9.38bn, on
a 1.2 per cent rise in sales to Y116.08bn from Y114.66bn. After-tax profits,
however, fell 8.5 per cent to Y3.28bn from Y3.59bn, due to a rise in tax
payments.
Fujisawa said a 16 per cent rise in exports offset a 1.4 per cent drop in
domestic sales. Sales in the domestic market were hurt by slack demand for
its antibiotics and anti-ulcer agent.
The company, however, benefited from cost-cutting efforts and increased the
ratio of in-house products.
It spent Y14bn on research and development during the half-year, 12.1 per
cent of its sales.
For the full year to March, Fujisawa expects a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y17bn and a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y233bn. After-tax profits
are expected to increase 7 per cent to Y6.5bn.
Ono Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized Japanese drugs company, also posted firm
first-half profits thanks to its diabetic neuropathy drug. Sales for the
half-year to September grew 16.2 per cent to Y45.9bn. Pre-tax profits rose
10.3 per cent to Y17.5bn. Net profits rose 2.7 per cent to Y7.4bn.
For the year to March, Ono expects a 14.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Y34.4bn on a 17.2 per cent increase in sales to Y93bn.
