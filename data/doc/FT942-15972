FT  13 APR 94 / Mediation hopes help financial rand recover
The financial rand, South Africa's investment currency, yesterday staged a
partial recovery from Monday's record lows, as the arrival of international
mediators raised hopes of a solution to the fighting in Natal province ahead
of all-race elections in two weeks.
The financial rand closed in London at R5.3350 to the dollar, its rise of
30.85 cents on the day recouping half of Monday's loss. However, the
commercial rand, the main trading currency, continued to weaken, dipping
1.28 cents to R3.6053.
Distracted over concerns about the currency, markets had little initial
reaction to news from the African National Congress that its economic plan
for the first post-apartheid government, the Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP), would cost R39bn over five years. It was the first time the
ANC had put a price tag to its programme, but officials immediately sought
to allay fears about the cost by claiming that the programme would be funded
without raising taxes or foreign borrowing.
On releasing the seventh and 'final' draft of the RDP programme, Mr Trevor
Manuel, ANC economics head, said the RDP could be funded by the redirection
of government funds away from areas like defence to needs such as housing.
Meanwhile Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, was hopeful of solving the
country's constitutional dispute, as seven international mediators  -
including Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary, and Mr Henry
Kissinger, former US secretary of state  - arrived in South Africa.
