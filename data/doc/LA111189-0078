BALTIMORE TO TAKE TRAINLOAD OF SEWAGE 
Baltimore officials have agreed to take back a trainload of sewage sludge after 
authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi refused to let a disposal company 
unload the waste in their states. The first of 63 carloads of the nonhazardous 
waste will begin arriving in about nine days at the Back River waste treatment 
plant that produced the sludge, city officials said. The 5,000 tons of sludge 
will be treated with lime and then transferred to a facility that will mix the 
waste with leaves and sell it as compost, George Balog, the city's public works 
director said.
