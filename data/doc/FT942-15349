FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further US blow for GrandMet
Grand Metropolitan is to lose US distribution rights to Grand Marnier, the
orange-flavoured liqueur owned by Marnier Lapostolle, the French
family-controlled company.
The rights have been transferred to Schieffelin &amp; Somerset, the US joint
venture between Guinness's United Distillers and Moet Hennessy whose parent,
LVMH, has an 8 per cent stake in Marnier Lapostolle. The joint venture
already distributes Grand Marnier in Japan.
It is another blow to Grand Metropolitan's IDV drinks arm which has just
lost the US distribution rights to Absolut vodka.
Grand Marnier sells about 400,000 cases a year in the US and analysts
estimate it generates profits of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m for
GrandMet compared with Pounds 25m from Absolut.
IDV said the two sides had failed to reach agreement on a new distribution
arrangement after the current contract expires at the end of this year.
IDV's separate distribution agreements for Grand Marnier in Australia,
Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy will all continue after January 1 1995.
UK distribution of Grand Marnier was recently switched from Matthew Clark to
Moet Hennessy.
GrandMet's shares fell 8p to 457p.
