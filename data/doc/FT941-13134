FT  27 JAN 94 / Appeal by convicted solicitor rejected
A solicitor jailed for mortgage fraud lost his appeals against conviction
and sentence yesterday. Mr Michael Farrell, of Knutsford, Cheshire, served
10 months of a 30-month prison sentence imposed at Liverpool crown court in
July 1992 on two charges of conspiracy to obtain property by deception.
Mr Farrell, who practised at Eccles, near Manchester, had claimed he was
duped and had no knowledge of any conspiracy.
Lord Justice McCowan, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Mr Justice Scott
Baker and Mr Justice Blofeld, said the trial judge's directions to the jury
were perfectly satisfactory. He rejected as 'wholly unjustified' criticism
of the judge's handling of the case.
'We are satisfied there was no badgering or hectoring of Mr Farrell, no
disparagement of his account and no hostility shown towards him by the
judge,' he said.
The appeal judges also refused to cut the length of the sentence. 'These
were very serious offences for a solicitor to commit and he did not plead
guilty. Therefore we are unable to say the sentence was wrong,' Lord Justice
McCowan said.
