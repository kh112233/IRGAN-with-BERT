FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK and Argentina begin fish
talks
BRITAIN AND Argentina began two days of talks yesterday to renew a temporary
agreement on sharing fish catches in the South Atlantic. Britain wants to
replace a one-year accord struck last December with a long-term agreement
that protects the Falkland islands' revenues, while Argentina wants to
increase substantially its fishing effort.
The unresolved dispute over the Falklands, which Argentina claims despite
defeat in its 1982 conflict with Britain, charges the talks with
considerable political significance.
Argentina began issuing fishing licences in competition with the Falklands
this year for the first time. Although it agreed in December to sell only 45
licences, it still forced a 12 per cent drop in the islands' licensing
revenues. In the financial year ending in June, the Falklands raised Pounds
23.5m in licensing revenues, compared with Pounds 26.8m in 1991-92.
The Falklands Fisheries Directorate is planning to lower the price of its
licences further and forecasts revenues this year of only Pounds 15m to
Pounds 15.5m.
Argentina also protested against London's decision earlier this year to
extend to 200 miles the territorial waters surrounding the British-held
South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina also claims. The
UK has introduced a licensing regime similar to the Falklands for the two
islands.
Buenos Aires is also using the fisheries talks to press for a role in the
development of possible oil and gas reserves in waters surrounding the
Falklands. The islanders have so far rejected oil talks with Argentina and
last year licensed two companies to carry out preliminary seismic surveys.
The islands plan to offer acreage to companies in 1994.
