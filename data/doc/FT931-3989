FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm shaken by political
turmoil
FURTHER political drama in Moscow unnerved early trading but activity was
generally mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM was shaken by the prospect of a political crisis of its own
provoking an early election and shares staged a sharp retreat from the
opening. But as tensions eased throughout the day, prices picked up leaving
the Affarsvarlden index 2.5 lower at 1,026.0.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel in London said the day's events had left
the market 'jittery'. He expected investors to pay closer attention to the
state of the Swedish economy, and in particular how much further domestic
interest rates could be expected to fall.
ABB was unchanged at SKr438 after reporting slightly lower 1992 profits,
while Volvo dipped SKr6 to SKr400, having traded as low as SKr387, as it
reported a record loss and cut its dividend for the first time.
Stora was SKr9 lower at SKr310 after announcing a loss and halving its
dividend, but Trelleborg firmed SKr3 to SKr61 ahead of its results after the
close.
FRANKFURT kept its eye on Bayer as the group cut its dividend by the
expected DM2 to DM11, underpinning its premium to BASF and Hoechst and
leaving the shares DM2.80 higher at DM279.80. Hoechst was flat at DM256, and
Bayer 70 pfg lower at DM239.80 as the DAX index rose 7.72 to a new 1993 high
of 1,717.40. Turnover eased from DM7.8bn to DM7.6bn.
Allianz rose DM28 to DM2,376, rebounding after last week's disappointment
with results from its German property and casualty insurance business.
The most consistently strong sector was construction, as Bilfinger, Hochtief
and Holzmann rose DM21 to DM1,007, DM33 to DM1,235 and DM54 to DM1,140 on
stories that a special fund was being set up to invest in the German
construction and property industries.
In engineering, KHD went ex-rights and fell a net DM3 to DM89.50. Mr Adrian
Hopkinson at NatWest Securities said that KHD had also produced a
disappointing progress report this week, which noted a severe fall in the
order intake for its agricultural machinery, especially tractors, and
forecast a break even in 1993 when analysts had expected something better,
after extensive rationalisation over the past three years.
PARIS was moderately weaker in a day's trading lacking direction or
enthusiasm. The CAC-40 index closed 3.48 higher at 1,988.94, in turnover of
FFr2.6bn.
Among Wednesday's gainers Chargeurs fell back FFr31 to FFr1,250 on
profit-taking, a factor which also characterised Lafarge's FFr3.50 fall to
FFr354.
Thomson-CSF weakened FFr1.60 to FFr159.60 in spite of announcing a FFr100m
order while financials were mixed, with UAP down FFr11 at FFr583 and SocGen
FFr12 firmer at FFr644.
MILAN edged higher in technical trade before the end of the March account
next Monday and the Comit index rose 4.06 to 520.71.
Sentiment was hurt by news that a parliamentary committee had refused to
give precedence to a government decree unblocking public works contracts
frozen because of the corruption scandal.
Among construction companies hit by the news, CogefarImpresit fell L30 to
L2,730 while Premafin, which fixed L270 ahead at L6,220 fell back to L6,180
after hours.
Elsewhere, Sip, the telecommunications group rose L12 to L1,660 after a
newspaper suggested, correctly in the event, that the board could decide on
a capital increase later in the day.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria rose L7 to L1,306 ahead of its confirmation, after the
market closed, that it was negotiating to sell a controlling stake of its
Erbamont pharmaceutical company to Sweden's Kabi-Pharmacia.
ZURICH finished slightly firmer at a record closing high, though below the
day's peak. The SMI index added 7.2 to 2,164.4. Pharmaceuticals were back in
fashion as worries waned that plans for healthcare reform in the US would
severely hurt Swiss groups. Ciba-Geigy bearers firmed SFr10 to SFr619.
BBC Brown Boveri bearers recovered from early losses to close SFr30 higher
at SFr4,070. Earlier the share fell as low as SFr3,970 after ABB, from which
BBC derives most of its income, announced its 1992 results. However, the
price recovered as investors noted that ABB had reduced its net debt to
zero.
AMSTERDAM remained relatively resilient with a 0.4 gain in the CBS Tendency
index to 105.8. Some investors chose to take profits in DSM which has been a
strong performer recently, the shares closing Fl 2.80 lower at Fl 80.60.
OSLO remained strong as the all-share index closed at a new 1993 high, up
4.2 at 435.8 in turnover of NKr407.4m.
ISTANBUL fell 3.6 per cent, closing 209.51 lower at 5,654.58 for a two-day
drop of 4.7 per cent on worries over higher bond rates and rising demand for
the lira.
