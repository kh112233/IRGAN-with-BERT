FT  16 NOV 93 / Component makers link up
HITACHI, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday launched a co-operative
programme aimed at improving the competitiveness of European electronic
component manufacturers.
Mr Toru Fukui, general manager of Hitachi's European office, warned that
without a guaranteed reliable and stable supply of components from western
Europe, both Japanese and European consumer electronics groups would be
forced to seek supplies in Asia or eastern Europe. He said manufacturers
based in Europe, whether Japanese or European, had 'a very serious common
headache'.
The Japanese group yesterday invited its own European suppliers - and
component manufacturers nominated by any European users - to take part in
the year-long programme.
Hitachi will promote exchanges of information between product manufacturers
and their suppliers, while asking its own engineers in Japan and at its
plant in Wales to guide suppliers on what manufacturers require. The Hitachi
programme is inspired by the EU-Japan joint initiative to strengthen
European components suppliers, launched in 1991. That programme has
encouraged Japanese and European consumer electronics groups, government,
European Commission officials and trade organisations to pool views on the
strengths and weaknesses of the European industry.
Mr Toru Fukui pointed out that more than 80 per cent of the VCRs
manufactured in Europe were now made by Japanese companies, and two-thirds
of the colour televisions.
