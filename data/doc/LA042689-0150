SHUTTLE CHECK IS 'SQUEAKY CLEAN' 
With ideal weather expected, engineers breezed through a "squeaky clean" 
countdown today for the shuttle Atlantis' launch Friday to fire a robot mapping 
probe to Venus in the first such U.S. project in 11 years. 
NASA's mission management team, a panel set up in the wake of the Challenger 
disaster to improve the agency's launch decision process, met to review the 
status of Atlantis' processing and to debate last-minute technical issues.
