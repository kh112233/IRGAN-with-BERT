  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (AFP)--Prominent Chinese dissident 
Wang Dan was released Tuesday after being held by Beijing police 
for an hour. 
  Wang Dan, 24, told AFP by telephone that he had been taken 
to 
a police station at 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and was released an 
hour later. 
  The former student leader during 1989 pro-democracy 
demonstrations was arrested by 10 policemen during an interview 
with five journalists from the American television network NBC 
at his residence. 
  "The police asked me how the journalists contacted me and 
what we had spoken about," he said, adding that the interview 
had focused on human rights, China's most favoured nation trade 
status with the United States and his private life.
