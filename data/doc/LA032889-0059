THE WORLD 
Laos has put on hold plans to cooperate with the United States against drug 
trafficking because of a U.S. report accusing Laotian government officials of 
involvement in the drug trade, Deputy Foreign Minister Souban Salitthilat said 
in Vientiane. "We were absolutely stunned and surprised at the American 
government report (issued March 1)," Souban said. Before the report, he said, 
Laos had been prepared to discuss direct U.S. aid and to send officials to the 
United States for anti-drug training. Under U.S. law, the negative report means 
that Laos cannot receive direct bilateral aid.
