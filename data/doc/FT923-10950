FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Oversight on precise Emu date
Sir, An oversight appears with alarming frequency in reports and articles in
your own and in other newspapers and magazines with regard to the final
stage of European Economic and Monetary Union (Emu).
One frequently reads that, according to the Treaty on European Union, which
was signed on February 7 1992, the third and final stage of Emu will begin
no later than 1999.
However, if we examine article 109j, stations 3 to 5 (inclusive) of the
treaty, we read that it is only if the date for the beginning of the final
phase has not been agreed upon by the end of 1997 that it shall start on
January 1 1999.
The ministers could, though, decide on July 1 2015, for example. Certainly,
if as at present, only two countries, France and Luxembourg, fulfilled the
strict criteria for economic conveyance and budgeting deficits - as laid
down in the relevant protocols - there would be little point in going on to
the final stage at any time this century.
There is unfortunately already a precedent for setting down dates for an
Emu. In 1970, the six founder member states of the European Economic
Community accepted the second and definitive Werner report, which aimed at
creating full European monetary union by 1980] Alas, we are all too
painfully aware of what happened to that attempt.
