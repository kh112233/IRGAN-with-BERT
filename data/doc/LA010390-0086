4 CAMPERS DIE IN MOTOR HOME; POOR VENTILATION OF GENERATOR BLAMED 
Four people have died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a motor home outside a 
mountain lodge east of here, authorities said Tuesday. 
Sheriff's investigators said the victims died New Year's Day while camping in 
Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest. 
The coroner's office identified them as Katherine Walsh, 30; Michael McCrae, 
32; Conan Lemmer, 28, and Graham Rayner, 28, all of San Diego. 
The four were on a vacation in McCrae's motor home and were using a generator 
to power a heater in the 30-degree weather, but the exhaust pipe was too short 
to allow proper ventilation, deputies said.
