FT  05 MAR 94 / Property: Why Ireland may be lucky for some - Whether you
want a cottage, a castle or an island, bargains abound
Rural Ireland offers extraordinary value for property buyers and now is a
good time to buy.
As in the 1980s, the Irish market will be mirroring the UK market, with a
lag of a year or two. Whether the rises will come later this year, or in
1995, is hard to say. When the market does improve, 'overseas' buyers,
mainly from the UK, will be in the driving seat - just as buyers from the
Far East gave the London market a kick-start to recovery.
If you buy now, you are almost certain to look back with a smile in the year
2000. Castles, large Georgian houses, bungalows and cottages are on offer at
remarkably low prices. The bigger they are, the less they cost in square
footage - but restoration and maintenance charges escalate.
Within commuting range of Dublin, prices have held firm. In the rest of the
country take your pick of properties at excellent prices in UK terms. Agents
and vendors will be glad to see you.
In the good years of 1988-90 the 'best buyers' of country houses in Ireland
came from the UK, says JBC Hamilton, of Jackson-Stops McCabe.
Of late, these UK purchasers have been absent, unable - or unwilling - to
sell their houses in Britain. That will change. Italians and Germans have
been buying in the meantime, but lower interest rates will allow the Irish
to re-enter their own market, particularly for substantial houses.
To buy a house in Ireland, you must learn to like the Irish way of life. You
might survive as a teetotaller - just - but you could not survive at all if
you did not enjoy talking. Ireland does not have a silent majority.
If you go hunting, shooting, fishing, betting at the races or are a
gardener, life will be richer. Leisure and tourism are vital for the rural
economy, where people often need several jobs to make ends meet. A village
carpenter may keep cattle as well - and go oyster fishing at the right time
of the year.
Taking advantage of the European Union's sheep payment regime is an art,
'provided you can get them to hobble past the inspector' my informant in
County Mayo said. It leads to ferocious overgrazing of the mountains in
winter. The sheep destroy the thin top layer of boggy turf. The gravel
subsoil then erodes and washes into the rivers, where it may affect the
fish.
But the economy needs outside money. The trickle-down effect of catching one
salmon on the fly, in terms of aircraft or ferry, use of car, hotel, food
and local support services, runs into many hundreds of pounds - a most
expensive way to buy fish. It is a pity then that sea-trout are fewer, as
they are suffering from sea lice, perhaps as a result of salmon farming.
If you do go to Ireland, recognise the importance of the house you choose to
buy. This may seem an odd remark but, unlike secular England, the concept of
spirit of place is rampant in Ireland. At all levels, houses have their own
life and control their owners. That is (partly) why impoverished gentry
still hang on to properties they cannot afford, and it is why their homes
were burnt down in the troubles of the 1920s. Then, their houses were not
just a symbol of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, they were the power behind it.
Jackson-Stops McCabe has a long list of such places, many in their third
year on the market. The recurrent phrase in Irish property particulars,
'open to offers', means what it says.
Prices start at about Pounds 250,000 - the UK and Irish pounds are virtually
at par - as with Moyne Park in County Galway, a Regency house built by the
family of Lord Sligo. It has been reduced from Pounds 350,000. The
particulars speak of 'the present owner, the late George MacBeth, a
distinguished poet and novelist'. Good Irish stuff. But the point is clear -
and it emphasises that powerful Irish spirit of place. (Sotheby's
International Realty is also an agent for this property.)
Greenstones Hall, at Glandore, in County Cork, is pink-painted Georgian.
Overlooking the harbour, which in 1900 had the largest fishing fleet along
the Cork coast, the house comes with a private boathouse and slipway, and
sub-tropical plants in the garden. The price for the whole is Pounds
850,000, from Charles P McCarthy.
Also in the pink, and with the same asking price, is Garretstown, at
Dunshaughlin, in County Meath, 20 miles from Dublin and commanding a Dublin
premium - but it is Georgesque, built in 1975. Agents are Hamilton Osborne
King and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Smaller Georgian houses include Carrick Lodge at Cornamona in County Galway
on the shores of Lough Corrib - excellent fishing - for Pounds 210,000 (down
from Pounds 300,000) from J-SM. Two gelebe houses - or old rectories of the
Anglican Church of Ireland - are available through McCarthy, in County Cork.
They are at Ballinadee (Pounds 359,000) and Drimoleague (Pounds 200,000).
Dukes Lodge at Athy, in County Kildare, an hour from Dublin, is a handsome
house built by the Duke of Leinster. It is on offer for Pounds 200,000 from
Ganly Walters.
Also of interest are the early 18th century Prospect House at Westport,
County Mayo, from J-SM and Brendan Tuohy for between Pounds 320,000 and
Pounds 380,000, and Corran House, at Leap, in County Cork for Pounds 235,000
from McCarthy. The company is also selling The Old Mill at Leap for Pounds
165,000, completely renovated in 1989.
Among castles, the 1882 Tulira in County Galway is still for sale from
Jackson-Stops McCabe and Sotheby's for Pounds 2m, and Hamilton Osborne King
has fully-furnished homes at Dromoland in County Clare, adjoining a golf
course, for Pounds 200,000. Perhaps the pick of the bunch should be
Strancally at Knockanore, County Waterford, set where the Bride and
Blackwater rivers meet. It is an early 19th century house and with 160 acres
is on offer from Jackson-Stops McCabe for Pounds 800,000-Pounds 850,000.
At the opposite end of society, cottages inland in County Leitrim may go for
as little as Pounds 5,000. On the west coast, Heaslip has several cottages,
old or new-in-the-old-style, in County Galway from Pounds 23,000 upwards.
More unusual is Heaslip's Old School House at Annaghdown, a solid
neo-Georgian building that personifies the importance of learning. It costs
Pounds 87,000 'open to offers'.
On Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, with 28 permanent inhabitants and a pub,
Ganly Walters is selling Stonefarm House for Pounds 150,000. If you need a
whole island with six smaller islands around, Dominic J Daly and Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley have the answer. It is Inishanboe, the 'island of the cow'.
The price is Pounds 1.5m.
