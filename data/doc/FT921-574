FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists wins control of Macarthy
LLOYDS Chemists, the fast-expanding chemist chain, yesterday won control of
Macarthy, its smaller rival, when its agreed Pounds 92.5m bid was accepted
by holders of 79.2 per cent of the ordinary shares.
The takeover will give Lloyds a total of 1,280 stores.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said last night he was
delighted by the response to the offer which had been recommended to
Macarthy shareholders by their board. Lloyds had tied up 26.2 per cent of
the shares before it made its bid.
The news came after the stock market closed with each company's shares at
328p, Lloyds down 2p and Macarthy down 1p. The offer was of one Lloyds share
for every Macarthy share.
A cash alternative at 305p has now closed, but holders of only 40,896 shares
had opted for cash. Holders of over 90 per cent of each class of Macarthy's
preference shares had also accepted.
Lloyds' bid was launched in February two days after clearance from the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission which had been examining two bids made for
Macarthy last year.
Originally Grampian Holdings, a Scottish mini-conglomerate, bid for Macarthy
in May last year but later pulled out. That was followed by bids from
UniChem, the retail and wholesale group, and Lloyds.
Both bids were referred to the MMC and cleared. However, UniChem decided
that the Macarthy price had risen too far by the time its bid was cleared.
Lloyds' success appears to have been based on three things: the
recommendation from Macarthy, the inclusion of a cash alternative, and the
acceptance of the bid terms by Govett Strategic Investment Trust for its
16.5 per cent stake before the offer was launched.
Lloyds had held 9.7 per cent of Macarthy's shares since its earlier bid.
