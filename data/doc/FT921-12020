FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Liechtenstein deals boosted MCC profits
Maxwell Communication Corporation's profits were 'topped up by
Maxwell-arranged deals with Liechtenstein trusts', Price Waterhouse said
yesterday.
The accountancy firm's comments follow years of unease among City
institutions about investing in MCC because of its reliance on property and
foreign exchange deals as a source of profits.
Speaking from Singapore, Mr David Lee, the partner responsible for the
investigation into fraud at MCC, said that uncovering the extent of these
transactions would not be easy because it relied on getting information
about half a dozen secretive Liechtenstein trusts and 'stiftungs'.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm which has audited the MCC
accounts for many years, said last night: 'There is nothing new about the
source of these profits, or the transactions between MCC and the private
Maxwell companies, which were shown in the MCC audited accounts.'
