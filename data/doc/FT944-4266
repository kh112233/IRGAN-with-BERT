FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: British boost for Argentina
Argentina's campaign to re-establish itself as a trustworthy trading partner
was boosted yesterday with the underwriting of a Dollars 9.5m buyer credit
by Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department, the biggest such deal since
ECGD cover was restored in June 1993. The approval by the ECGD, which
suspended cover after the Falklands conflict in 1982, will be seen by
Argentina as a significant step towards repairing its damaged international
image. In spite of the ending of hyperinflation and the unleashing of very
fast growth rates, Argentina has not yet entirely overcome its past
reputation, tarnished by military governments and virtual economic collapse.
The ECGD decision follows the successful bid by Babcock International of the
UK to supply computer-controlled inspection equipment to the Atucha II
nuclear power station being built 70 miles north-west of Buenos Aires.
Although ECGD premiums to Argentina were reduced by Britain last December,
UK businessmen in Buenos Aires complain that the country-risk premium is
still too high, given Argentina's recent solid economic performance. Mr
Nicolas Grose-Hodge, president of the Argentine-British Chamber of Commerce,
believes British companies may have lost millions of pounds worth of
business because high ECGD premiums have rendered bids uncompetitive.
