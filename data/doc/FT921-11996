FT  29 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Move on Estonia debt
repayment
ESTONIA may be exempted from repaying debts to Britain dating from before
the Soviet invasion in 1940. The debts include Republic of Estonia bond
issues worth about Pounds 600,000 (Dollars 1.02m) held by British nationals
before the Soviet annexation of the Baltic state.
Representatives of the Estonian government and Bank of Estonia have met
officials from the Bank of England, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
Treasury in London to discuss outstanding financial claims between the two
countries.
Britain announced last week it has agreed to return gold deposits to
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The gold was deposited with the Bank of
England in 1940 at the time of the Soviet takeover, and was sold on the open
market by the UK government in 1967 for Pounds 5.8m, much to the Baltic
states' annoyance. However, it seems likely that following the resolution of
the gold issue, Estonia and Britain will waive outstanding claims. According
to Foreign Office documents, Estonia's debts to British nationals amount to
Pounds 609,587, relating to a sterling bond issue and a dollar bond issue,
while Estonian assets - excluding the gold - held in the UK amount to Pounds
492,907, including bank accounts and securities.
Last year, Estonia hinted the state was prepared to honour its debts,
although now this will not be necessary.
