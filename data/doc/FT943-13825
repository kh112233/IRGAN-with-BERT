FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: At the Louvre - Eating Out
If there is one thing Paris probably does not need it is another cafe: but
there is always room for somewhere special such as Cafe Marly, the new
brasserie in the heart of the Louvre Museum.
Cafe Marly is the brainchild of Gilbert Costes, whose Philippe
Starck-designed Cafe Costes in Les Halles was one of the hottest places in
Paris during the mid-1980s but has since deteriorated into a tourist trap.
His new venture boasts one of the best locations in the city: buried in the
Richelieu wing, the part of the Louvre that once housed the French finance
ministry but reopened last autumn as a spectacular new extension to the
museum.
Through a window looking into Cour Marly, the diners in the Marly restaurant
have a stunning view of the sculpture liberated from the royal palace
gardens by the 1789 revolutionaries. The Cour Marly is one of the palatial
glazed courtyards created by IM Pei, the Chinese-American architect
responsible for the Louvre renovation scheme.
The brasserie windows overlook Pei's Louvre Pyramid, while the 18th century
interior has been restyled in an uncompromisingly contemporary combination
of black, red and gold.
The best views, however, are from the terrace which looks out over the whole
Cour Napoleon, from the Fritz Langesque tourists lining up by the Pyramid to
the Tuileries Gardens.
As for the menu, the Marly offers the standard, if unspectacular fare dished
up at other fashionable Paris brasseries, such as Cafe de Flore or Brasserie
Lipp on Boulevard Saint-Germain the other side of the Seine.
The price of the food is surprisingly reasonable with lunch for two totting
up to around FFr400 (Dollars 76).
But drinks on the terrace are as absurdly expensive as anywhere else in
Paris - even if the Marly is, of course, the only place to throw in a bird's
eye view of the Pyramid for free.
