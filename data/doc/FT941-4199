FT  12 MAR 94 / House passes Clinton budget
The House of Representatives last night passed President Clinton's Dollars
1,500bn budget which contains strict spending limits that leave little room
for administration initiatives. The 222-164 vote was along strict party
lines. No Republicans voted for it. The budget, little changed from the way
Mr Clinton proposed it for the 1995 fiscal year starting October 1, will now
go to the Senate.
