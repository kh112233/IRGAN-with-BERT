FT  28 APR 94 / Pilot junior market planned
A pilot scheme to develop a new mechanism for trading in the shares of small
companies could become a reality in Scotland later this year as part of the
plan launched on Tuesday by the London Stock Exchange.
The exchange has accepted an offer from Scottish Enterprise, the official
economic development body, and Scottish Financial Enterprise, which
represents the Scottish financial sector, to try to create a junior market
for smaller companies in Scotland to meet shortfalls in its treatment of
small companies. The involvement of Scottish Enterprise means the exchange
can tap public-sector funds.
The two bodies believe the Scottish financial community can provide
institutional finance for companies quoted on the new market, and has the
lawyers, accountants and stockbrokers to service it.
The first step will be the setting up of a working group. Mr John Laydon, an
executive with Scottish Financial Enterprise, said yesterday he hoped
trading on the new market could begin this year. It would need to promote
itself to attract companies outside Scotland as well as within.
Initially, matched bargain trades could be displayed on screen, with brokers
making deals by telephone. Later the market would move to on-screen
dealmaking.
Critics of the initiative question whether new trading mechanisms, wherever
based, can overcome the fact that there is a shortage in liquidity in
trading in small companies.
