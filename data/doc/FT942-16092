FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Anglo Eastern hits Pounds 2.8m
Profits before tax of Anglo-Eastern Plantations, which came under the
control of Genton International last year, rose from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds
2.84m for the year to end-December.
Turnover improved from Pounds 4.93m to Pounds 8.01m. Crop at the Tasik oil
palm estate was 63 per cent higher than in 1992 while rubber and cocoa
production was up to expectations.
Earnings jumped to 7.4p (3.4p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.15p makes
a 1.65p (1.375p) total.
The board intends to broaden the group's activities in the Asia Pacific
region and maintain Anglo-Eastern's London listing.
Last September Chillington Corporation sold a 48.08 per cent stake in
Anglo-Eastern to Hong Kong-based Genton which then made a mandatory cash
offer for the balance of the shares.
