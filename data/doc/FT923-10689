FT  29 JUL 92 / Maastricht to boost growth says IMF
THE International Monetary Fund expects the Maastricht treaty on European
union to help, not hurt, the economies of the 12-nation European Community
in the long run, IMF officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
This is one of the conclusions of a draft IMF report expected to be released
in September, they said. The report discounts worries that criteria for
monetary union, such as low budget deficits and reduced inflation, will hurt
European economic growth and affect the world economy.
The officials denied a report in the French newspaper Liberation that the
IMF had concluded the Maastricht treaty would depress EC economic growth by
0.4-0.8 per cent over the next 2-4 years. Although the treaty would reduce
growth by 0.75 per cent in 1993, growth in each of the following three years
would be more than a quarter point higher than otherwise, they said.
