FT  15 SEP 92 / Hawaiian island recovers
TROOPS patrolled and helped clean up neighbourhoods and officials tended to
more than 7,000 people in shelters as the hurricane-hit Hawaiian island of
Kauai took its first halting steps toward normality yesterday, AP reports
from Lihue.
Federal officials said 10,000 homes were badly damaged when Hawaii's worst
storm this century tore across the resort island. Most of the island's 70
hotels sustained serious damage.
A limited phone service was restored, giving the island's 52,000 residents
their first link to the outside world since the storm hit on Friday.
