Three nurses in one of Vienna's oldest hospitals have been arrested on 
suspicion of killing up to 35 patients with drug overdoses, Austrian 
authorities said. The newspaper Die Presse said it was "the biggest mass 
killing in Austria's criminal history." Vienna Police Chief Guenther Boegl said 
the three female nurses, ranging in age from 26 to 30, worked in the Lainz 
Hospital on the city's western outskirts and have admitted killing a number of 
patients with lethal injections that included insulin, normally used to treat 
diabetes. "It appears they acted out of a misguided sense of mercy, but we are 
also investigating other motives," Boegl said. "Not all the patients were 
terminally ill."
