FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (1): The picture darkens -
Despite a series of shock events in Latin America this year, the flow of
capital should continue, albeit at a slower rate. Stephen Fidler discusses
prospects for the future and suggests that external investors may become
more selective
Investors in Latin American financial assets have been rocked this year by a
series of events that have provided a timely reminder of the risks of
investment in the area's emerging markets. They have been left questioning
their previous expectations about future economic growth and political
stability. Yet, although the shocks may result in more selectivity by
investors, there are reasons to expect a continued net flow of private
capital into the region.
As Latin America's main importer of capital, Mexico sets the tone for the
region's financial markets. The implementation on January 1 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico was
expected to provide a base for inward investment flows to Mexico and to help
avoid the usual financial uncertainty that plagued the country in each of
the three previous presidential election years.
It was not to be. The new year was also greeted by a peasant rebellion in
the state of Chiapas which shocked the administration of President Carlos
Salinas. Then the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling
party's presidential candidate, further shook the government. To some
foreign investors, the two events underlined previously-underestimated
political risks associated with Mr Salinas's economic reform programme.
Outside Mexico, other events also shifted perceptions of investor risk. In
Argentina, unrest among provincial government employees in Santiago del
Estero was interpreted by some as a parallel to Chiapas in that it showed
signs of opposition to President Carlos Menem's market-oriented reform
programme. (The government argued that the cause was an unreformed
provincial administration.)
From Venezuela, where the administration of President Rafael Caldera was
elected on a platform opposing market reform efforts, the collapse of the
second largest bank, Banco Latino, increased concerns. Later, the government
suffered a downgrading of its debt, the first for a country that had
previously issued Brady bonds in a debt restructuring.
In Brazil, the one Latin country where inflation has not fallen, investors
worried about elections later this year given the leadership in opinion
polls of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate from the
left-wing Workers' Party.
Yet the event that engendered the largest market correction occurred outside
the region: an initial one quarter point interest rate increase by the US
Federal Reserve in February. The direction of the change was no surprise,
but it came earlier than many investors expected. US interest rates
influence Latin America's financial markets in many ways. Low interest rates
in the US have driven US-based investors - many of them Latin Americans - to
seek higher returns from regional markets where tight monetary policy and
high interest rates have held sway. Low US interest rates also encouraged US
retail investors to shift resources into mutual funds, a significant portion
of which have been seeking high returns in emerging markets including those
in Latin America.
But a third factor appears to explain the magnitude of the correction in
Latin markets. This was the extent to which buyers of Latin American assets
were highly leveraged - borrowing money to buy debt in particular.
Ms Cathy O'Donnell, senior vice-president at one of the largest emerging
market debt traders, Chase Manhattan, said: 'When a lot of investors are
leveraged and the market goes down, the investors' losses are magnified. If
you are in a downward spiral, it feeds on itself because of leverage.'
It was also clear that dealers in emerging market debt were on the whole
heavy with inventory following the price increases of last year and the
positive perspective encouraged by Nafta. They, too, were forced to lighten
their books and sell into a falling market.
Mr Neil Allen, head of emerging markets at Bankers Trust in New York, viewed
the rally in Latin America which ended in February as both a trend and a
fad. For those attempting to develop long-term business in the region, 'the
fad is not always your friend', he said.
Not all of Latin America's new investors are so interest-rate sensitive or
driven by fads. The emerging markets of Latin America, Asia and eastern
Europe are now recognised by institutional investors such as pension funds
as an important target for investment.
Sharp corrections in stock and bond markets in developed countries, such as
has been experienced in recent weeks, will inevitably slow flows to emerging
markets, but many observers expect that over the medium term the investment
will continue.
'We are seeing the beginnings of a large portfolio shift that can last 10 to
15 years,' said Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy managing director of the
Institute for International Finance in Washington, a think tank owned by
international banks.
Mr John Purcell, head of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers,
said: 'I think pension funds and mutual funds are going to come back to the
market.' Mutual funds - accounting for about 6 per cent of the financial
assets held by individuals in the US - have been growing rapidly but 'are
nowhere near as large as they are eventually going to get'. This suggests a
continued flow of funds to emerging markets.
Furthermore, Latin America's capital inflows are not totally dependent on
portfolio investors. Foreign direct investment has been spurred by economic
reform and, although much of this has been on the back of once-and-for-all
privatisation programmes, can be expected to continue - so long as economic
growth remains positive.
International banks, having been burned by the debt crisis, are returning to
the region, too. Most banks have changed substantially since the early 1980s
and are never likely again to use their balance sheets to provide
large-scale medium-term finance for the region. Now most prefer to be in
Latin America not as lenders, but as traders and underwriters. But there are
signs that some lending will take place, as suggested by a Dollars 1.1bn
financing arranged this year for Mexico's Petroleos Mexicanos by JP Morgan -
said to be the first voluntary bank loan for a Mexican sovereign entity
since the 1982 debt crisis.
If a slowing - rather than an outright halt - of capital inflows to Latin
America is what is in prospect, it may be no bad thing. The volume of the
flows in recent years has worried some observers and has caused problems in
monetary management in many countries. In the medium term, the
sustainability of inflows will depend heavily on economic performance. Since
performance will diverge from country to country, so it is likely that
capital flows will become more selective.
Despite the Brady plan and other debt reduction efforts, many countries
remain relatively heavily indebted and have yet to develop strong foreign
exchange earnings capacity that will be needed to service their foreign
liabilities in the future. According to Ms Marilyn Skiles, an economist with
JP Morgan: 'The current availability of external finance provides these
countries with an opportunity to develop competitive export sectors. Unless
this happens, the countries may be vulnerable at some point in the future to
a sudden shift in investor preferences.'
The international capital market is an often capricious master as this year
has forcefully demonstrated. While Latin America continues to need foreign
capital, its governments are likely to be subject to its whims. Liberation
will come only for those countries that succeed in the difficult task of
increasing their own domestic savings rates.
