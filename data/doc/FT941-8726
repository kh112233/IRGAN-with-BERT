FT  18 FEB 94 / Electricity price curbs announced
Two more regional electricity companies have responded to last week's
price-capping agreement by the power generators. London Electricity said its
cuts would average 1 per cent to 2 per cent for business customers using
more than 100kWh a year. Yorkshire Electricity said it would freeze prices
for domestic and smaller business customers from April.
