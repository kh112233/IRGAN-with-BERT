WORLD IN BRIEF; 
FLORIDA; 
LIFE SUPPORT ENDED; COCAINE VICTIM DIES 
A Miami man who slipped into a coma after drinking a Colombian soft drink that 
had been laced with cocaine in an apparent smuggling scheme died after doctors 
disconnected life-support equipment. 
Maximo Rene Menendez, 25, collapsed on July 26 after drinking from a six-ounce 
bottle of Pony Malta de Bavaria. FBI experts have discovered at least 45 
contaminated bottles containing 20 to 40 grams of the drug in a 1,000-case 
shipment of the soft drink. Federal officials warned consumers that hundreds of 
cases of Pony Malta distributed in southern Florida are unaccounted for.
