FT  20 JUL 94 / Unionists receive settlement pledge
Mr John Major yesterday reassured senior Ulster Unionists that efforts to
forge a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland would not lead to
Dublin sharing authority over the province.
The prime minister told Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, that he had no
intention of 'moving in the direction' of joint sovereignty over the
province.
In a one-hour meeting at Downing Street the two men also discussed security
matters and the purpose of the framework document that London has been
attempting to agree with the Irish government.
The meeting, which was attended by other senior figures from both sides, was
portrayed as the latest in a series of discussions with leaders of the
province's main political parties.
Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic
and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party, has been pencilled in for next week.
Mr Molyneaux said the prime minister had given a 'definite, firm assurance
that he was not in the business of joint authority, joint sovereignty or
even the slippery slope leading to either of these two developments'.
But in remarks likely to reassure Dublin, senior Downing Street officials
later emphasised that the establishment of new north-south institutions with
executive powers had not been ruled out.
Yesterday's meeting came 24 hours after Dublin responded with annoyance to a
newspaper interview with Sir Patrick Mayhew in which the Northern Ireland
secretary indicated that Dublin's territorial claim over Ulster was the
central issue to be resolved in drafting the framework document.
It came five days before Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is due to
decide its formal response to last year's Downing Street Declaration.
