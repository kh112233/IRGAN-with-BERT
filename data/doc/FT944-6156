FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Avesco losses higher after demerger
Avesco, the broadcast equipment and services group, yesterday announced an
interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.94m, mainly reflecting the cost of spinning
off VideoLogic, the multimedia company.
It also announced the acquisition of Tontel, a TV animation group trading as
Excess, for Pounds 625,000.
The group now consists of three divisions - television studios producing
programmes for both the BBC and independent television; giant TV screens for
use at concerts and sporting events; and video/audio support systems for
presentations.
The pre-tax loss for the half-year to the end of September was struck after
charging Pounds 6.4m for the demerger, and compares with a loss of Pounds
2.32m previously. Total turnover was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 10.9m).
The pre-tax profit from the continuing services operations was Pounds
250,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.03m, compared with Pounds 704,000 on Pounds
4.61m previously.
Shareholders will vote on December 23 on the adoption of a new share option
scheme, an increase in the authorised share capital, and a reduction in the
share premium account.
Mr Murray said yesterday that he had invested his own money in Excess
because it was apparent that Avesco could not do the deal while in the
throes of the spin-off.
The loss per share for the half was 9.19p (2.97p loss), a and earnings were
0.29p (0.93p).
