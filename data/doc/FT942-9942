FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Consortium named to build Portuguese dam
Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power producer and distributor,
has awarded a Es15.7bn (Pounds 61.28m) contract to build the country's
biggest hydro-electric dam to a consortium of French, Spanish and Portuguese
companies.
The 136m-high dam at Vila Nova de Foz Coa in north-eastern Portugal is to
form part of an Es52bn (Pounds 201m) hydro-electric power plant comprising
two 72 MW reversible turbine units. They are due to begin production of 330
GWh a year in 1999.
The winning consortium comprises Dumez of France, Agroman of Spain and the
Portuguese companies Somague and Moniz da Maia Serra e Fortunato. A total of
16 Portuguese and 13 companies competed for the contract.
The dam will form an 18 sq km artificial lake of 700m cubic metres. The
plant will provide a strategic reserve in case of breakdown or low capacity
of EDP's other hydro-electric plants on the Douro river, which flows into
northern Portugal from Spain.
Installing reversible turbine units will enable EDP to transfer waters from
the Douro to the Foz Coa lake for subsequent use by power plants along the
river.
