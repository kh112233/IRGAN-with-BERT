FT  10 FEB 94 / Patten orders inquiry into length of school day
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday ordered an inquiry into
the length of the school day, despite a report from the education watchdog
which said this had little or no effect on standards.
League tables showing how many hours each school in England and Wales
teaches its pupils a week, are being considered.
The report, by the Office of Standards in Education, found 'little direct
correlation between the amount of teaching time allocated to pupils and
their overall standards of achievement'.
It found wide disparities, with taught time in primary schools varying
between 20 and 24.2 hours. The government's recommended minimum school week
for children in the last three years of primary education is 23.5 hours.
Ofsted also found that schools teaching less than the recommended minimum
'can, and often do, give their pupils short change in terms of the quality
and extent of the education provided'. In secondary schools using the short
week, the inspectors found that some subjects were not receiving the full
treatment required by the national curriculum.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'It is the quality, not the quantity of teaching which
counts and the government must avoid being seduced by an argument that comes
perilously close to 'never mind the quality, feel the width'.'
