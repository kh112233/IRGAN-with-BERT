FT  26 JUN 92 / People: Executive Appointments
Rob Margetts (above left), the 45-year-old chief executive of ICI's Tioxide
business, has been appointed to the main ICI board in a move which marks him
out as a rising star in the increasingly elderly executive team running
Britain's biggest chemicals company.
Margetts, who is a Cambridge graduate in chemical engineering, has been
respon-sible for restructuring the recently acquired Tioxide business.
Before that he had been the general manager in charge of personnel and
director of engineering. He will be the youngest member of an executive team
whose average age is in the upper 50s.
Although ICI has not disclosed what role Margetts will play after he joins
the board on September 1, he may shoulder some of the responsibilities of
Frank Whiteley who is retiring as deputy chairman on reaching ICI's normal
retirement age of 62 in November.
Alan Pedder, 54, is to take over as chairman and chief executive of Tioxide,
following Margetts' promotion. Pedder is currently managing director of
ICI's international polyurethanes business and before that was managing
director of ICI Fibres.

Meanwhile, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, has been
appointed a non-executive director of ICI.
Sir Ralph Robins (above right), chief executive and deputy chairman of
Rolls-Royce, is to become a non-executive director of Marks and Spencer. He
brings a wide industrial experience to the job. Apart from his leading
position at the aero-engine group, Sir Ralph also boasts directorships of
Standard Chartered, Schroders and ASW Holdings.
He will become M and S's sixth non-executive director. The board also has 15
executive directors and a company secretary.
