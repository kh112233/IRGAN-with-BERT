FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Now real debate on European union
begins - Vote is unlikely to end crisis of legitimacy surrounding the treaty
DENMARK'S decisive Yes to Maastricht will cause the political establishments
across Europe to breathe a sigh of relief. In the UK, the result should tip
the scales decisively in favour of Mr John Major as he pushes the Maastricht
bill through its final stages in the UK parliament. Barring an upset in the
British or German courts, ratification seems secure.
Yet the Danish Yes is unlikely to end the crisis of legitimacy surrounding
the treaty. When EC leaders agreed Maastricht in December 1991, they hailed
it as point of departure for European political and monetary union; but even
the latest Commission polls show public support for European integration is
tumbling.
The Danish endorsement does not amount to a true test of public support for
European union. The version of Maastricht which Danes approved yesterday
contains legally binding opt-outs on core elements of the treaty, including
the single European currency, European citizenship and defence policy.
A senior European Commission official declares the treaty will have no
obvious impact on the fundamental problems facing the EC such as rising
unemployment, low investment, public spending crises in almost all the
member states and monetary instability.
The Danish Yes should free the Commission and member-states to focus on the
Community's pressing challenges: enlargement negotiations with Austria,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden; the political and economic integration of the
former Communist countries of eastern Europe; and the issue of European
competitiveness in relation to the US and Asia, itself the subject of an
in-depth study ordered by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president.
A senior EC official listed several 'tests' for the Community in the coming
months: making the single market work, including the removal of lingering
restrictions on the free movement of EC citizens; concluding the Uruguay
Round in the Gatt trade talks; and ensuring stability inside the European
exchange rate mechanism so as to maintain the credibility of the EC to
monetary union by 1999 at the latest.
Paradoxically, the Danish Yes may reignite the debate on European union. The
run-up to European parliament elections next year is an obvious launch-pad;
so, too, the sense among the European federalists that they no longer need
worry about frightening the minimalist Danes or the British as they edge
toward ratification. Belgium, which takes over the EC presidency from
Denmark on July 1, is in the lead.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, is coming from a different
direction. In a speech to the French parliament yesterday, he spoke of a new
division of labour within the Community so that countries such as France,
Britain and Germany could take the lead on security matters. He also hinted
that the EC needed to make institutional changes to cope with 16 or more
members. The first clues on Commission thinking will probably come next
month when it offers an opinion on Malta's request for membership.
Last weekend, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian foreign minister, came out in
favour of watering down the strict Maastricht 'convergence' criteria for
monetary union - a move which would allow an inner core of EC member states
to move forward to fixed exchange rates, but which would alarm the
Bundesbank, which has insisted that Maastricht must be respected to the
letter.
All this may simply be letting off steam; but it may also suggest that the
debate on the future course of the EC may be about to begin. For if
Euro-sceptics and Euro-enthusiasts agree on anything, it is that Maastricht
settled nothing.
