FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
Continuing hopes of a reduction in interest rates, and a firm performance in
bonds, helped stock index futures to a premium as the March contract pulled
the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,227 was 6
points below the previous night's close, which initially led dealers to
expect a quiet session. But those early doubts soon faded, leaving March to
advance for most of the session, with 'solid US buying' said to have been
prominent in the first part of the day.
Having touched the day's high of 3,278, the contract finished at 3,272, up
39 from its previous close and at a 6-point premium to cash. Volume at the
official close was a healthy 16,480 contracts.
The Liffe Mid 250 March contract ended at 3,907 after business of 285 lots,
and June, which becomes the market leader next week, saw volume of 225
contracts. On the OMLX, the screens showed there had been no trade in the
FT-SE Mid 250 contract.
Turnover in Liffe traded options improved to 40,369 lots, with 21,792
contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,043 in the Euro FT-SE option.
Ladbroke was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,309 trades.
