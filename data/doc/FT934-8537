FT  15 NOV 93 / Union bid for United Airlines fails
A FIVE-MONTH attempt by unions at United Airlines to buy a majority stake in
the large US carrier has fallen apart, and the failure threatens to spark
off strife between labour and management.
United, one of the big three US carriers, wants to improve its profitability
by a restructuring plan, lay-offs and a sale of assets which its unions
oppose.
The unions, which made an abortive attempt to buy out the airline four years
ago, have warned of 'Armageddon' if the company pursues its restructuring.
However, United said the takeover proposal from its pilots and machinists
unions was 'seriously deficient', and reiterated that it would continue its
cost-cutting.
This will focus on its short-haul domestic routes, where it faces mounting
competition from 'no frills' low-fare airlines. 'United continues to be
non-competitive in the short-haul market and everyone knows something has to
be done about it,' the company said.
Its plans also include the sale of 15 of its 17 flight kitchens to Dobbs
International for Dollars 119.4m (Pounds 79m), which will mean the lay-off
of 5,000 staff. The pilots and machinists' unions expressed 'bitter
disappointment that management has placed short-term profits from the sale
of the flight kitchens ahead of the interests of all employees and
shareholders'.
The takeover talks apparently broke down on Friday because of disagreement
over the value of the unions' offer.
