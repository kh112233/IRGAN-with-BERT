FT  16 JUN 93 / Bayer offshoot faces CDollars 2m pricing fine
A CANADIAN court has imposed a CDollars 2m (Pounds 1m) fine on Chemagro, a
Montreal-based insecticide company owned by Bayer, the German chemicals
group, for a price-fixing conspiracy.
This is the heaviest penalty ever imposed under Canada's competition law. It
marks the first conviction under a provision which prohibits
foreign-directed conspiracies designed to lessen competition in Canada.
The case involved sales of various chemical and biological insecticides used
in forests. Chemagro pleaded guilty to several charges of colluding with
other suppliers, both within Canada and abroad, to fix prices on supplies of
these chemicals sold to provincial governments and the private sector.
Price-fixing was orchestrated outside Canada by Bayer and Sumitomo Chemicals
of Japan. Sumitomo's case is still before the attorney-general.
