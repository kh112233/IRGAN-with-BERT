FT  30 APR 94 / Business hesitates over cash for D-day
Companies approached for sponsorship for D-day events have become hesitant
about committing themselves in the face of hostility from veterans'
associations such as the Royal British Legion.
GEC and Hanson are thought to have been approached by the London public
relations agency Lowe Bell - acting on behalf of the Department of National
Heritage - to back a programme of events.
These would include a possible concert in Hyde Park involving Dame Vera
Lynn, the singer and 'forces sweetheart' of the second world war.
The Royal British Legion, which represents 750,000 people and is the largest
ex-service organisation in the country, has made known its opposition.
It said yesterday: 'We do not know the position on the Hyde Park event
because it is very sketchy. But yes we do feel that any event should be in
keeping with the occasion and we are not sure that a concert of this kind
would be appropriate. We have nothing against Dame Vera Lynn, of course.'
GEC said yesterday: 'Nothing has been decided about D-day.' Hanson, another
of Britain's largest companies, would only say: 'We are examining what
contribution we can make to D-day.'
The group declined to say whether it had been approached for sponsorship.
The Department of National Heritage confirmed that Lowe Bell had been hired
to sound out industrial companies and other organisations, including media
groups, about the possibilities for sponsorship, but said nothing had been
decided about the Hyde Park event.
The department last week issued assurances to veterans that the anniversary
would not be trivialised.
The Royal British Legion was at pains to point out that the national
programme being contemplated by the national heritage department was what
was at issue.
The programme of commemoration services in Portsmouth and Normandy, some of
which will be attended by the Queen and other heads of state, was not in
contention.
