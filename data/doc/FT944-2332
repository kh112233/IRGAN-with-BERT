FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Apollo back in the black with Pounds
291,000
Apollo Metals swung back into profit during its second half to finish the
year to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 291,000, against Pounds
1.02m last time, writes Paul Cheeseright.
The company incurred a first-half loss of Pounds 219,000.
The outcome was slightly higher than the forecast made in October when the
aluminium and specialist steel distributor and processor launched a Pounds
7.79m rights issue to finance the acquisition of Aviation Metals.
Turnover rose from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 33.7m, but after meeting
reorganisation costs in Germany, operating profits fell from Pounds 1.42m to
Pounds 564,000.
Although earnings per share were nil, against 5p, the group is confident
enough of trading prospects to hold the final dividend at 2.4p, maintaining
the total at 3.6p.
