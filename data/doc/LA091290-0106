Waste Not: An unlikely competitor in hazardous waste disposal turns out to be 
the cement industry. Cement kilns are increasingly burning hazardous waste for 
fuel. Kilns not only neutralize the wastes but turn them into part of their 
finished product. LaFarge Corp.'s Systec Environmental division, which serves 
600 hazardous waste producers in the United States and Canada, says it can burn 
anything its customers produce: waste solvents, paints, inks, pharmaceuticals 
and cosmetics. A kiln operates at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 800 degrees hotter 
than the typical waste incinerator. That exceeds the Environmental Protection 
Agency's guidelines for temperatures that neutralize hazardous compounds.

Recycling Agreement: Du Pont Canada and Procter &amp; Gamble are cooperating on 
a breakthrough program to recover high-density polyethylene plastic bottles. 
The program calls for bottles to be ground into flakes and processed into 
pellets by Du Pont and Waste Management Inc. of Burlington, Ontario. The 
pellets would be sold to Procter &amp; Gamble, which has contracted with Plax 
Inc., also of Burlington, to incorporate the pellets into a new line of plastic 
bottles. Toronto Globe and Mail 
Sunny Side: Michael Food Inc. of St. Louis Park, Minn., has extended the 
convenience food frontier with a precooked omelet. It can be heated in a 
microwave or conventional oven and keeps in a refrigerator for 30 days. The 
product recently began a market test in Minneapolis-St. Paul, packaged with 
precooked hash browns. A company spokesman calls the omelet "the most 
value-added egg product in our egg division." City Business
