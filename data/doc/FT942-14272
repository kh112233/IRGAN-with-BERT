FT  21 APR 94 / SeaCat spotted on the Thames
Hoverspeed's cross-channel ferry SeaCat Great Britain paid a visit to the
Thames yesterday. Hoverspeed plans more frequent sailings, increased
capacity and expanded tax-free shopping in an attempt to win more custom
before the launch of full Channel tunnel service later this year, Charles
Batchelor writes. Great Britain's capacity has been increased from 450 to
600 passengers by adding extra seats. Return sailings on the
Folkestone-Boulogne route have increased from four to five a day, two
steering jets have been added and improvements are planned to give a
smoother ride. The sea journey takes 35 minutes and the motorway to
autoroute time is 50 minutes.
Agreement has been reached with Rolls-Royce for the supply of spares for the
company's hovercraft to extend their working life beyond the year 2000. In
addition Pounds 1m has been spent on a tax-free shopping terminal at
Boulogne. There are also plans to upgrade port facilities in Folkestone and
Dover.
