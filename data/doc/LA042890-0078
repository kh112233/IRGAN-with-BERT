NATION IN BRIEF; 
NEW YORK; 
2,000 FLEE VIOLENCE ON INDIAN LAND 
Some 2,000 Mohawk Indians began evacuating their reservation to escape 
factional violence that has left roadways lined with burned cars and caused 
residents, including children, to brandish arms. 
One man was critically injured in the violence and another was missing. The 
reservation straddles New York and Canada, but the violence so far has taken 
place on the United States side. After a week of nightly confrontations between 
Indians who support casino gambling and bingo on the U.S. side and those who 
oppose it, Canadian Mohawk leaders evacuated women, children and the elderly 
from the village of St. Regis in Quebec, which is near the violence on the New 
York state border.
