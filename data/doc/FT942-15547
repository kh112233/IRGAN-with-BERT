FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels slips 14% in first
quarter
Hilton Hotels saw its first quarter net income fall 14 per cent to Dollars
22.7m, or 47 cents a share. However, the US group's hotel operations put in
a strong performance.
Group revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 338.8m from Dollars 331.6m a year
ago.
The hotel side, continuing the recovery that began in the second half of
1993 and reflecting improved results at many of its leading-market
properties, posted operating income of Dollars 20.7m, a 62 per cent
improvement.
Several Hilton flagship hotels, including the Waldorf-Astoria, New York
Hilton and Towers, New Orleans Hilton Riverside, Hilton Hawaiian Village and
San Francisco Hilton and Towers reported stronger results.
While occupancy was flat at 66 per cent, compared with last year operating
results benefited from an overall increase of 4 per cent in average room
rate and a 5 per cent rise in revenue per available room.
Hilton said a 20 per cent decline in operating income from gaming - to
Dollars 38.6m from Dollars 48.3m a year ago - was attributable primarily to
unusually high table game win percentages in the 1993 quarter at the Las
Vegas Hilton.
The 1994 quarter was also hit by construction work at the Flamingo Hilton
Las Vegas.
