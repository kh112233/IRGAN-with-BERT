FT  16 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
Prices paid for wool in Australia this week show little overall change
compared with closing sales before the Christmas recess. Drought effects
have tended to lower prices for finer categories, while well-grown broader
types have become slightly dearer. There is trade confidence in a firm price
outlook for the rest of the season, with demand matching reduced supply.
This is despite no sign of demand from the old Soviet Union areas, nor
payment of wool debts due from there.  The market indicator was 576c/kg,
which compares with 578c/kg at the closing sale in December.
