FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Estonia central bank is exception
Sir, John Lloyd reports on the politicisation of central banking in the
republics of the former Soviet Union ('A cry for freedom', May 3). While Mr
Lloyd correctly concludes that Estonia and Latvia are success stories, he
omits fully to explain why they are exceptions to the rule. In June of 1992,
Estonia introduced a currency board-like system. Under that system, monetary
policy is solely rule driven and insulated from political meddling. Although
Latvia has a central bank that can engage indiscretionary monetary policy,
it has been operating as if it was a currency board. Moreover, the Latvian
central bankers have kept the politicians at bay by threatening to introduce
currency board legislation, if the politicians should meddle in monetary
affairs.
Mr Lloyd also commits an error of commission. He concludes that it is
probably too late for other republics to follow the lead of Estonia and
Latvia. That is not true. In Lithuania, Mr Aldolfas Slezevicius mounted a
successful campaign earlier this year to depoliticise monetary policy with
the introduction of a currency board-like system. Such a system was
installed on April 1. Now the litas must be fully backed by foreign reserve
currencies and gold and freely convertible at a fixed rate of 4 litai per US
dollar.
