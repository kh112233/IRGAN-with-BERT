FT  30 OCT 93 / British Gas and Tenneco win Chilean pipeline deal
BRITISH GAS and Tenneco Gas of the US were yesterday awarded a contract to
operate a Dollars 1.65bn project to pipe natural gas from Argentina to
Chile.
The 1,200km pipeline, which would transport gas from Argentina's Neuquen
fields to businesses and homes in Santiago and other Chilean cities, has a
target completion date of 1997.
Chilectra, the project developer and leader of a consortium that has
negotiated a gas supply contract with Argentina, named Tenneco as the
technical operator of the transmission company.
British Gas will take responsibility for the 8,000km distribution network.
The British and US companies beat off stiff competition from other
international companies, including Enron, Lonestar Gas and Utili-corp of the
US, and Transcanada Pipelines and Novacorp International of Canada.
The two companies, which would take out an equity stake in the project, will
undertake feasibility studies before going ahead with construction in 1994.
British Gas's share of the study costs will be less than Dollars 2.25m.
Securing financing may be difficult given the estimated six years of
negative cash flows involved and the 20-year payback period.
The transmission and distribution elements of the contract, not including
three thermo-electric generators, are likely to cost between Dollars 950m
and Dollars 1.2bn.
There is also political risk. Although Chile was awarded an investment grade
rating last year, Argentina's economic stability is still to be tested.
Relations between the two countries, although much improved, have often been
strained - a factor that could interrupt the smooth flow of gas.
