FT  11 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Chemical recovery project
Wimpey's specialist offshore engineers have begun an operation to avert
toxic danger to marine life in the Atlantic Ocean.
Underwater grouting supplied by the transatlantic arm of WIMPEY GEOTECH is
forming the nucleus of a USDollars 6m (Pounds 3.3m) salvage operation to
recover toxic chemicals off Cape May in New Jersey.
Four containers holding a total of 441 drums of arsenic trioxide and sodium
cyanide slipped from the decks of carqo vessel Santa Clara 1 during a storm
in January 1992.
The containers settled 30 miles offshore, spilling the drums in a prime
fishing zone which is also the habitat of the endangered Right whale and the
Kemp Ridley sea turtle.
Working at depths of 40 metres, remote control vehicles fitted with robotic
arms will place the chemical drums into oversized caskets. The space around
the drums will then be filled with a high density cement grout mixed by
Wimpey Geotech on board the recovery vessel and pumped into place using
specialist equipment and services. The grout will be allowed to harden
before the caskets are brought to the surface for salvage and safe disposal.
Work started in March and is expected to continue for three months.
