FT  24 AUG 92 / World News In Brief: Germany's SPD reverses policy on
immigration
Germany's opposition Social Democrats have reversed their policies on
refugees and the use of German forces in UN-led operations, which they now
no longer oppose. The call for curbs on immigration, by SPD leader Bjorn
Engholm, came on a weekend when over 200 skinheads and neo-Nazis clashed
with police outside a refugee hostel in Rostock, eastern Germany. The police
used tear gas and water cannon as the protestors, egged on by hundreds of
spectators, threw petrol bombs, stones and fireworks at the hostel.
