FT  08 OCT 93 / Cocaine seizures soar in Europe
COCAINE seized by European customs authorities was up 42 per cent in the
first half of this year, on the same period in 1992, customs officials said
yesterday.
European officials seized 9,800kg of cocaine in the first six months of
1993, against 6,914kg in the first half of 1992, the Brussels-based Customs
Co-operation Council said. The amount of cannabis seized in Europe during
the first half of the year also increased, from 80 to 91 tonnes
The amount of heroin seized decreased in western Europe, but rose in the
east European countries. Mr Georges Davrou, deputy director of the CCC's
technical division, said yesterday that it was too early to tell whether the
abolition of many of the EC's internal frontier controls on January 1 had
had any effect. Customs officials have always argued that more illicit drugs
are seized following tip-offs or large-scale cross-border operations than as
a result of random checks.
The nine members of the Schengen free-travel accord - all 12 EC countries
except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - have pledged to lift remaining
passport controls from December. Although it supports the deadline, France,
in particular, has expressed concern about the flow of drugs.
