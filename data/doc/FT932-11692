FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Genentech shares jump 16%
SHARES in Genentech, the Swiss-controlled and California-based biotechnology
company, jumped by 16 per cent yesterday to Dollars 37 7/8 after an
independent medical study concluded that the company's Activase heart attack
drug was more effective than others.
Genentech had financed most of the Dollars 55m study, known as Gusto. It was
one of the largest clinical trials of heart attack patients ever undertaken
and involved 41,000 patients in the US and 15 other countries.
The company's sales of Activase had dropped considerably in 1992 following
an Oxford University study called Isis-3 that questioned the effectiveness
of Activase.
A RIVAL antidepressant to Prozac, the leading antidepressant drug, may soon
be available in the US following yesterday's decision by an advisory panel
to the Food and Drug Administration to recommend Effexor, writes Karen
Zagor.
The new drug, made by a unit of American Home Products, was described as
effective for patients who have never been treated for depression and for
those who do not respond well to their current medication. The most common
side effects are nausea, drowsiness and dizziness.
Although decisions by the advisory panel are not binding, the FDA generally
rules in favour of drugs which are recommended for marketing.
Prozac has been under steady pressure in recent years. The Church of
Scientology has waged a campaign against the drug claiming it makes people
suicidal.
More recently, Pfizer's Zoloft has proved tough competition, and SmithKline
Beecham's recently-launched Paxil has now entered the fray.
