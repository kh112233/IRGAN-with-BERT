FT  07 MAR 94 / EU stresses stance on holdings in BAe
European Commission officials in Brussels yesterday denied that there had
been any public protest to the UK government over the limits on overseas
shareholdings in British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce.
However, the commission warned yesterday that the limits, agreed with the
government in 1989 after a year of wrangling, were always regarded as
temporary. Now that they had technically expired the commission - which is
concerned the restrictions infringe European Union rules - would not want to
create a precedent by allowing the situation to continue.
The government, which insists on a limit for national security reasons, had
planned to raise the ceiling from 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent after
complaints from the companies that it artificially depressed their share
prices.
Officials said yesterday no decision had yet been reached by the commission,
but with the limits on overseas ownership clearly contravening the spirit of
the single market, it was unlikely to favour any extension of a situation
which distinguished between British and other EU shareholders.
After the privatisation of Rolls-Royce in 1987, the government had wanted
the limit to be 15 per cent but was forced to increase it to 29.5 per cent.
Both BAe and Rolls-Royce would like to see the limit removed altogether.
