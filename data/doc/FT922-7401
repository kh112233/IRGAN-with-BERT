FT  19 MAY 92 / Lonrho chief holds talks with Gadaffi in Tripoli
MR TINY Rowland, chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday had a two-hour meeting
with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi in the Libyan leader's heavily fortified
offices in central Tripoli.
Last night Mr Rowland was still talking to government officials in Tripoli
about what are believed to be 'substantial misunderstandings' between Libya
and the UK-based conglomerate.
Lonrho sold a one-third stake in its Metropole Hotels to Libya for Pounds
177m in March, but yesterday denied that it planned to sell its African
interests, including gold and platinum mining operations, to Libya. The
denial was issued in response to a Sunday newspaper article, which Lonrho
said was based on claims by an individual with whom Lonrho was in legal
dispute.
Last night Mr Rowland, accompanied by Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho
East Africa, was meeting a Libyan minister and representatives from the
Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, the Libyan government's investment
agency.
The US administration is investigating Lonrho's dealings with Libya, after
secret visits by Mr Rowland to Col Gadaffi. Lonrho has denied that the
investigation might lead to the company being blacklisted in the US.
Lonrho has been keen to reduce gearing by disposals. Earlier this month it
sold George Outram, publisher of The Herald and Evening Times in Glasgow,
for Pounds 70m.
