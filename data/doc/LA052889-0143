Jerry Anderson, who played briefly for the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, drowned after pulling two boys out of a rain-swollen river at 
Murfreesboro, Tenn. 
Police officer Bill Todd said rescue workers pulled Anderson from the lake and 
took him to a local medical center, but efforts to revive him failed. 
Five years ago, Anderson helped Tulsa, Okla., residents who were trapped in 
buildings and cars during a flood. He was honored by the city for his heroic 
actions.
