FT  23 JUL 94 / Yeltsin makes concessions on privatisation
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed a decree ordering the continuation
of Russia's privatisation programme but made unspecified concessions to
deputies who had blocked the plans. The decree clears the way for a new
stage of privatisation in which companies will be auctioned for cash
following the completion of the sale of up to 70 per cent of manufacturing
industry for vouchers distributed free to every Russian citizen. But Mr
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's spokesman, said the decree,
necessitated by parliament's failure to adopt the second stage of
privatisation as ordinary legislation, took into account some of the
deputies' objections. Although he gave no details, the changes are likely to
give more leeway to local authorities and company employees in deciding how
companies are privatised. The decree is also likely to drop proposals for
the privatisation of land. After outright rejection of the plan for
'post-voucher' privatisation at the start of this month, parliament this
week failed to muster a quorum in support of the compromise version because
many deputies had already gone on holiday.
