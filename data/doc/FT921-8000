FT  19 FEB 92 / French companies offer to bury Chernobyl nuclear reactor to
prevent radioactive leaks
French companies have offered to bury the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in a new
aluminium-based 'super-cement' guaranteed to prevent radioactive leaks for a
century, their spokesmen said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Lafarge-Fondu International, the cement maker, said the offer to entomb the
damaged reactor was made after a two-week inspection by French experts.
Bouygues, the construction group, said it was also involved in the project,
in response to a tender by Ukraine's government.
