FT  24 FEB 94 / Regulator warms to British Gas
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it believes the senior management of
British Gas 'has genuinely embraced competition' only two months after the
government decreed that the company's monopoly in supplying 18m mainly
residential customers should be ended in 1998.
Ms Claire Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said in presenting the
regulator's annual report yesterday that 'on many fronts we both have the
same strategic aims'.
The regulator's enthusiastic assessment of British Gas's attitude to
competition was in marked contrast to earlier reports, in which the company
came in for severe criticism.
Ms Spottiswoode conceded, however, that British Gas's new attitude to future
competition was based in large part on its desire to reduce the influence of
the regulator on its businesses.
She said positive changes are already apparent as a result of the company's
decision last year to restructure its domestic operations into five business
areas.
She noted that the heads of the company's public gas supply business and its
transport and storage division were diverging on a number of issues, a sign
that the separation of the businesses was beginning to function.
The report praised British Gas for making good progress in slowing the rate
of growth in the number of consumer complaints.
Ofgas received 1,842 complaints from consumers last year compared with 1,827
in 1992 and 968 in 1991.
Progress was also being made on the consultation document which will contain
detailed plans for ending British Gas's monopoly. This will begin in 1996
with the opening to competition of 5 per cent of the market for users of
fewer than 2,500 therms a year.
The paper, which will be published jointly with the Department of Trade and
Industry, has been sent to ministers. Publication is expected by the middle
of next month.
