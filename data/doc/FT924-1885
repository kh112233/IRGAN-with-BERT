FT  16 DEC 92 / Ministers advance date to end CFCs use
EC environment ministers last night agreed to end the use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and some other chemicals which deplete the ozone
layer, by January 1995.
This is a year earlier than the targets agreed last month in Copenhagen by
the Montreal Protocol, the 93-nation pact governing action on the ozone
layer, where the EC had argued for faster phase-out of ozone-damaging
substances.
It was agreed in Copenhagen to reduce CFC use by 75 per cent by the end of
next year, and and phase them out entirely by 1996, four years ahead of the
pact's previous schedule. The Community had moved to the 1996 date in March,
and plans to eliminate 85 per cent of CFCs by the end of next year.
CFCs, used mostly in refrigeration, aerosols, air conditioning and
insulation, have done most to thin the ozone layer. Scientists predict an
increase in eye cataract conditions and skin cancer, caused by the
ultra-violet radiation the ozone layer filters out.
The EC will also phase out use of carbon tetrachloride, a dry-cleaning
solvent, by 1995, instead of 1996. Halons, used in fire-extinguishers, will
be eliminated by the end of next year instead of 2000, and trichloroethane,
used to clean precision instruments, will go by 1996 instead of 2000. This
keeps the EC dates agreed in March, despite efforts by Germany and the
Brussels Commission to speed up elimination.
Ministers also agreed to adopt tighter exhaust emission targets for light
trucks.
