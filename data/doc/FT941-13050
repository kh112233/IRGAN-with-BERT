FT  27 JAN 94 / Observer: Monastic numerology
What would Luca Pacioli, the Venetian monk credited with inventing
double-entry bookkeeping, think of the unseemly battle brewing in his name?
This year is the 500th anniversary of the publication of his last word on
the subject, Summa de Arithmetica, Geometrica, Proportioni et
Proportionalita. Pacioli's countrymen may have been yawning but the
accountancy world is in ferment.
A couple of US academics want to mark the occasion, but they have been
trumped already by the elderly Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland which is planning its own 'Festival of Accounting'.
Not to be outdone, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales is now entering the lists with 'Figures in proportion', an exhibition
of its own original edition of Pacioli's ancient masterpiece. With all the
excitement about double-entry accounting, the only unknown is whether the
organisers can count on double-digit attendance.
