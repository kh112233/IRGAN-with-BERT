21 ARRESTED, CASH AND DRUGS SEIZED ON MOHAWK LAND 
Canadian police seized about $800,000 in drugs and cash on strife-torn Mohawk 
territory and arrested 21 people on drug and weapons charges Thursday. 
About 100 officers led by Ontario Provincial Police seized cocaine and 
marijuana from homes at Cornwall Island on the St. Regis Indian Reservation and 
in nearby Cornwall, Ontario, police spokesman Peter West said. 
Twelve guns were seized, including at least three automatic rifles. Police also 
seized about $32,000 in U.S. currency. 
In addition to the 21 people arrested, 16 were being sought, West said. Police 
said about half of the suspects lived on the reservation, which straddles the 
U.S.-Canadian border. 
Authorities said the raid was not connected with a violence-filled struggle 
over gambling rights on the reservation. 
Reservation violence had been quelled since hundreds of New York and Canadian 
police swarmed onto the Mohawk land on May 1, when two Indians were shot to 
death in a 10-month-old casino gambling feud.
