FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Lower finance costs lift CPC
CPC International, the US food company whose brands include Hellmann's
mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, yesterday reported a 9 per cent
increase in net income to Dollars 98.1m for the first quarter, helped by
volume gains and lower financing costs.
World-wide volumes rose by 9 per cent, about a third of which came from
acquisitions - among them the Pfanni potato products business in Germany.
Unfavourable exchange rates affected the value of sales in dollar terms, but
the combination of volume gains and higher prices produced an overall
increase of 6 per cent in turnover to Dollars 1.74bn.
Best Foods, CPC's North American food business, saw sales growth of 9 per
cent on increased volumes of Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola oil, Skippy
peanut butter, Karo syrups and Knorr products.
However, specialty baking and Mueller's pasta were down, and higher
commodity prices combined with increased spending on marketing and product
development left North American operating income flat.
Growth in overall operating income came from CPC's international operations
 -particularly in Latin America, where consumer foods recorded a 25 per cent
increase.
But Mr C. R. Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive, warned that the
Latin American business would be significantly affected by the difficult
business environment in Brazil in the second quarter.
Finance costs fell to Dollars 20.2m from Dollars 22.8m, leaving pre-tax
profits up 9 per cent at Dollars 172.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 63 cents from 58 cents and the dividend is 34
cents a share, up from 32 cents.
