KENYA BURNS IVORY IN PLEA FOR BAN 
Kenya burned 12 tons of ivory worth more than $3 million today in a gesture 
symbolizing its commitment to protecting the African elephant. 
Kenya is leading a campaign for a global ban of the ivory trade, and the 
bonfire was a message to poachers of elephants that it considers the ivory 
market closed. 
President Daniel Arap Moi, who set alight the ivory in Nairobi's national park, 
branded the act as a historic effort aimed at preventing a "terrible 
environmental tragedy -- the extinction of Africa's elephant." 
Most of the ivory burned had been confiscated by the government from poachers, 
who have cut Kenya's elephant herd to 17,000 from more than 65,000 a decade 
ago.
