SHIP WRECK FOUND IN MASSACHUSETTS BAY 
The wreck of the Portland, a 280-foot side-wheel steamer that claimed more than 
160 lives when it sank in a ferocious 1898 storm, has been found in 
Massachusetts Bay, a maritime explorer said Friday. 
John Fish, co-director of Historical Maritime Group of New England, said his 
crew used sonar equipment this week to confirm that they had found the ship in 
waters north of Cape Cod.
