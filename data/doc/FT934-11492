FT  30 OCT 93 / Pay for MPs set to rise by 5.5%
PLANS to offer MPs a two-year 5.5 per cent pay rise prompted fierce
criticism yesterday.
Under proposals to be debated next Wednesday, MPs would be awarded a 2.7 per
cent increase, taking their salaries to Pounds 31,687 with effect from
January 1994. This would be followed by a further 2.68 per cent the
following year. The government also proposes to link MPs' pay to a range of
civil service bands.
The government is this year seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent ceiling on the
public-sector pay bill, and may try to impose a freeze next year.
Mr Michael Bates, Tory MP for Langbaurgh, said: 'It is an absolute outrage.
This is a time when we are asking all public servants to play their part in
having a pay freeze.'
Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, Britain's biggest union, said: 'It
would be grossly hypocritical for ministers and MPs to vote themselves an
increase nearly twice the figure to which public-sector workers are being
restricted this year.' Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union,
said: 'Aren't they the lucky ones? I wish our members had the chance to vote
themselves a pay rise at twice the rate of inflation.'
Officials said the proposed increase was a catching-up exercise. A formula
linking MPs' pay to the civil service was abandoned more than a year ago
when civil servants' rises were made dependent on performance. MPs' pay has
been frozen since then, while civil servants have seen increases of 3.9 per
cent from August 1992 and 1.5 per cent this year. Last year MPs voted
themselves a 38 per cent rise office-cost allowances to nearly Pounds 40,000
a year.
