FT  22 JUL 94 / Astra faces EU ban on top drug
The German medicine institute, responsible for licensing drugs, has called
for a EU-wide ban on the injectable version of Losec, the top-selling
product of the Swedish pharmaceuticals group Astra. The EU's committee for
proprietary medicinal products will meet on Monday in Brussels to discuss
the issue. The German institute is concerned that Losec, an anti-ulcer
medicine, could cause blindness in some cases when administered by
injection. Between 40 and 50 incidents have been reported, according to
Astra. Losec is the group's most important product and saw sales in all its
versions last year of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn). Sales this year have
increased by about 40 per cent, making it one of the world's fastest growing
medicines. Astra's B shares fell SKr1 to SKr161 (Pounds 13.40) yesterday.
The German institute has questioned only the injectable version of Losec,
not the pill form which represents about 97 per cent of all sales. However,
intravenous versions account for a higher proportion of sales in Europe.
Astra said it was looking forward to having the opportunity to defend the
safety record of Losec, one of the most significant competitors to Glaxo's
top-selling medicine Zantac.
