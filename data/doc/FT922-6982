FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Children's charity fears about World Bank priority
for poorest (1)
Sir, The recognition by the World Bank that the global environment debate
has largely ignored the most serious problems facing developing countries
('Environment debate 'ignores plight of poor'', May 18) should be given a
guarded welcome. Many individuals and organisations, including Save the
children, will support the 'priorities for action' listed in the World
Bank's World Development Report. These include stress on the need to address
the problems of lack of clean water and adequate sanitation. That the
welcome should be 'guarded' is because of fears about the priority which
will be given to that list of priorities.
Throughout the 1980s the World Bank played a dominant role in promoting
structural adjustment policies in many developing countries. Save the
Children and other organisations argued that the effects of such policies on
the most vulnerable in society, particularly children, should be considered
in advance. The World Bank and International Monetary fund were urged to
adopt policies which would seek to improve the productivity and income of
the poor and were told that services vital for the most vulnerable should be
reinforced.
Despite the welcome comments in the World Bank report, particularly on the
need for education for women, fears remain that the World Bank sees concern
for the poorest as something which can be tacked on to an otherwise
unchanged policy of economic adjustment.
Save the Children hopes that these fears are unfounded. International
institutions must recognise that human and environmental objectives, like
the needs of mothers and children, must be at the centre of an integrated,
longer-term development policy.
