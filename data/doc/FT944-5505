FT  03 DEC 94 / Labour postpones devolution answers
The way Scotland would be represented at Westminster after a Labour
government had set up a Scottish parliament can be decided only after Labour
has implemented all the changes it plans for the UK's regions.
Mr George Robertson, the shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday that the
party was embarking on a dynamic process of constitutional change. There
would not be a 'pat answer' to every question concerning future regional
representation at Westminster. New anomalies would be created, he said.
Mr Robertson reiterated Labour's commitment to establish a Scottish
parliament and a Welsh assembly in its first year in office. It would then
set up regional assemblies in different parts of England.
Labour has been criticised by the Conservatives for failing to give detailed
answers to the questions of how Scotland and Wales will be represented at
Westminster after their assemblies are established.
In particular it has been challenged to answer the so-called West Lothian
question: why should Scottish MPs at Westminster be able to legislate for
matters such as education in England while English MPs will not be able to
legislate for education in Scotland?
Mr Robertson told the Scottish constitutional convention, an unofficial body
boycotted by the Tories and the Scottish National party, that there would be
'no precise point where everything must instantly adapt to accommodate just
some of the new institutions'.
Rather than get lost in 'the forest of detail and constitutional porridge',
it was more important to tell people what the Scottish parliament 'can do
and will do to change their lives'. It should outline options for issues
such as housing, community care, education, transport and the health
service.
