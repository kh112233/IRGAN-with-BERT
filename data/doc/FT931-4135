FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Literacy standards criticised
PILOT TESTS carried out last year in preparation for the compulsory testing
of English for all 14-year-olds revealed 'unacceptable' reading and writing
levels, Mr John Patten, education secretary told MPs yesterday, John Willman
writes.
One in three of the 12,000 14-year-olds who took part in the pilot had the
reading and writing ability of an average 11-year-old or less, Mr Patten
told the Commons education committee. About 5 per cent were only at the
level of an average seven-year-old.
The tests were conducted in 102 schools across England to pilot the
compulsory testing of all 14-year-olds in English which begins this summer.
Mr Patten said that the figures were 'disturbing' and showed the importance
of testing to identify children who need extra help and direct it to them.
The minister appealed to teaching unions not to boycott the tests. Earlier
this week the NAS/UWT, the second largest teachers' union, said its members
had voted overwhelmingly to boycott assessment and testing associated with
the national curriculum.
The NUT, the largest teaching union, will ballot its members in May over
plans to boycott just the English tests for 14-year-olds.
