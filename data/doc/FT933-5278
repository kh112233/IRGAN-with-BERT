FT  04 SEP 93 / Belgian currency under more pressure
THE BELGIAN central bank again intervened on the currency markets yesterday
to support the Belgian franc, but failed to prevent a further slide in its
value against the D-Mark, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The currency closed at BFr21.77 against the D-Mark yesterday compared with
BFr21.455 on Thursday evening. A spokeswoman for the central bank said no
special announcements were planned for the weekend.
Some foreign exchange dealers were suggesting yesterday that the authorities
might announce abandonment of the strong link between the franc and the
D-Mark before trading reopened on Monday. The bank said a weekend
devaluation was 'impossible'.
Mr Yves Mersch, director of the Luxembourg treasury, said yesterday there
was 'absolutely no reason' for a devaluation. The Luxembourg and Belgian
franc are part of a currency union.
On Thursday, the Belgian bank threw its full weight behind the 'franc fort'
policy by raising official interest rates by one percentage point and
intervening on the currency markets. The bank has blamed misleading press
reports for making the Belgian franc an attractive target for speculation.
