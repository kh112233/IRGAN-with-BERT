  [Text] Nairobi, May 22 (AFP) - The mostly Tutsi Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) Sunday [22 May] seized the government-held 
Camp Kanombe barracks near Kigali airport which they had 
captured earlier in the day, UN officials announced. 
  Hundreds of people fled the camp after the rebels had taken 
the airport following days of intense shelling. The barracks 
accommodated up to 4,000 government troops until recently and 
were the biggest in the Rwandan capital, according to a UN 
estimate. 
  UN spokesman Abdul Kabia earlier announced by telephone in 
Rwanda that the airport, where 200 Ghanaian UN troops are 
stationed, fell to the RPF at about 6.00 a.m. (0400 GMT) with no 
casualties reported. 
  "The RPF soldiers are everywhere, in the buildings, on the 
runway," one military source said.
