FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Flotation being planned by
cruise operator
ROYAL Caribbean Cruises, one of the largest cruise ship operators in the US,
is coming to the stock market.
The Miami-based company has made its 'initial public offering' filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It did not detail the precise timing for the flotation, nor the number of
shares to be offered. However, it did register 9.08m shares at a proposed
maximum offering price of Dollars 19 a share. It said the proceeds would be
used to repay secured debt facilities. Anything remaining would go for
'general purposes'.
Royal Caribbean was formed in the 1960s by three Norwegian companies - I. M.
Skaugen, Gotaas Larsen and Anders Wilhelmsen - and merged with Admiral
Cruises in 1988. In that year, Anders Wilhelmsen bought out the other
partners and set up a joint ownership arrangement with interests related to
Chicago's Pritzker family. The company operates nine ships.
