FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: K-9 Hall
Among the many suggestions for the future use of London's redundant County
Hall, its advantages as a police dog training centre have not received much
attention.
However, Observer can disclose that many of London's 389 police dogs have
honed their skills sniffing the secrets of the old GLC power house.
The London Residuary Body - charged with selling the site - says that there
have been police dog classes in former GLC buildings for a long time.
However, since County Hall is now the only empty GLC building, it follows
that most police dog classes are held there.
Interesting to see whether the London School of Economics will permit the
classes to continue if it buys County Hall. No doubt it could charge extra
if it provided the dogs with a few stroppy students to practice on.
