FT  28 JAN 94 / Watchdog may bar six from securities
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is
considering barring six individuals permanently from the securities
industry, Norma Cohen writes.
It is the first time SIB will have used its powers to ban people under
Section 59 of the Financial Services Act.
SIB said it would consider banning those whose actions over time revealed
they should not participate in the industry or those who, with a single
action, demonstrated they were unfit to conduct investment business.
There has been industry speculation that the SIB would attempt to bar former
officials of Inescomim for their role in connection with the disappearance
of assets from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
The six, who have not been identified, will be given one month to challenge
the order.
