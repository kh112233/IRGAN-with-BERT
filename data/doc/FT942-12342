FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6):
Inflation-proofing matters, but don't lose sight of today - A regular income
3 / Annuities  / While the range of annuities has been widening in recent
years, increased longevity and the trend towards early retirement have
combined to make the choice more difficult
An annuity is the regular income, usually for life, that is secured by
payment of a lump sum to an insurance company.
For retired people in their late sixties or older, annuity rates are very
competitive, compared with other guaranteed income products. But investors
must appreciate that once the annuity has been bought it cannot be changed;
and in most cases the purchase fund is forfeited on death.
Most people come across annuities in the context of 'money purchase'
pensions - that is, pension arrangements which invest contributions to
provide a fund at retirement, rather than base the pension on the employee's
final salary.
Under these arrangements, the bulk of the accumulated fund must be used to
buy a 'compulsory purchase annuity' (CPA) from a life office, which then
guarantees to pay a lifetime income.
There is, however, a second type of annuity, known as a 'purchased life
annuity' (PLA), which is bought voluntarily by individuals who need to
receive a regular income, either for a fixed period or for life.
Annuities can only be sold by life offices, due to their ability to cover a
large spread of risk. Purchased life annuities are complex products, and it
is essential to seek independent advice to obtain the best value for your
lump sum investment.
The amount of guaranteed regular income you receive in return for your
lump-sum investment is broadly determined by the prevailing gilt rates, and
can therefore fluctuate considerably. Age is also a major factor, since the
insurance companies use mortality tables to assess your life expectancy, and
offer lower rates where the annuity is likely to be paid over a longer
period, as can be seen by comparing the figures in Table 1, A and B.
Since, on average, women live about seven years longer than men, female
annuity rates are lower than rates for men of the same age.
The annuity most commonly sold provides a fixed or level income for life.
The popularity of this product is primarily due to the fact that it provides
the highest income at the outset compared with other options. Clearly,
however, once inflation takes its toll the value of the income plummets, as
can be seen in Table 2.
The trend towards early retirement - whether voluntary or enforced -
combined with increased longevity, exacerbates this problem.
In recent years the choice of annuities has increased. For example, you can
arrange to have annual increases, of 3 or 5 per cent, or increases linked to
the retail price index. Clearly, inflation-proofing makes sense, but it is
important to appreciate that this feature carries a cost in terms of a
forfeit of income in the early years to compensate for increasing income in
the latter years.
For example, an annuity that increases by 5 per cent each year provides an
initial income about 30 per cent lower than that provided by the level
annuity, as can be seen by comparing the figures in Table 1, B and C.
Of course, eventually the cumulative income from both annuities will break
even, and after this point the escalating annuity will provide much better
value - but only for those blessed with longevity. What is important is that
each individual should strike a balance between their need to safeguard
their income against inflation and their need for immediate spending power.
Other factors to consider are whether you should take out the annuity on a
joint life basis. This is the most popular option for couples, since the
annuity income does not stop on the death of one partner but continues to be
paid until the second partner dies.
One of the biggest problems with annuities is that to get the best rates you
must hand over your capital for good. Even if you die the following week,
there is no return. Those who would like to pass on some of their money to
their children should examine the rates offered on annuities with a capital
protection guarantee.
Under this arrangement, if you die and the gross amount you have received to
date is less than the original purchase price, the balance is paid into your
estate.
Annuity payments can be arranged on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or
annual basis. Unlike compulsory purchase annuities, which are taxed in full,
with a purchased life annuity only part of the income is taxed.
Peter Quinton, managing director of the Annuity Bureau, explained: 'Each
annuity payment is divided into two parts, a capital element and an interest
element. Tax is deducted from the interest element at the time of payment,
but the capital element is tax-free.'
The tax charged is at the rate that applies to your total income, including
the interest element of the annuity which is added to your other earned and
unearned income. Quinton added: 'If you are a non-taxpayer, it is possible
for the whole of the annuity to be paid tax-free.' For higher-rate
taxpayers, the interest element should be declared on an annual tax return,
since basic-rate tax is the maximum amount deducted at source.
Those with a money-purchase pension, who have the choice between using the
whole fund at retirement to buy a compulsory purchase annuity or taking part
of the fund as a tax-free cash lump sum, should opt for the latter
arrangement if they are after maximum income. Quinton said: 'This can then
be invested in a purchased life annuity, to provide an income which in part
is tax-free. Under the compulsory purchase annuity, the whole of the income
is subject to tax.'
