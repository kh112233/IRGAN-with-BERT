FT  29 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
COFFEE prices ended at the top of the day's range at the London Commodity
Exchange as buyers were encouraged by the New York market's apparent desire
to build on Wednesday's gains, brought on by the news Brazil had approved
the funding to begin buying coffee under the producers' export retention
scheme. After hovering just under Dollars 1,200 a tonne, for near January
delivery, for most of the day, the second position managed to make a more
substantive break above, closing at Dollars 1,211 a tonne, up Dollars 32 on
the day. Dealers said , however that the real test would come be when the
market ran into producer selling, which they expected at about Dollars 1,250
a tonne. COCOA prices also held steady with the March delivery position
reaching Pounds 980 a tonne, before closing Pounds 12 up on balance at
Pounds 976. Dealers thought the market was becoming range-bound after
repeated failures to improve on the recent high of Pounds 991 a tonne. ZINC
was the exception to generally dull trading at the London Metal Exchange.
The three months position gained Dollars 15.75 at Dollars 943.50 a tonne
against persistent background talk of a European output cut.
