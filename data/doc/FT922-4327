FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: HK telecoms accord raises profit
doubts
THE HONG Kong govern-ment's new regulatory agreement with Hongkong
Telecommunications has left the company worse off, according to local
analysts. They say the accord has failed to remove uncertainty over future
regulation of its key international telecoms business.
The measures announced this week could open Hong Kong's domestic telecoms
market to increased competition after 1995.
The two parties agreed to change from profit control of domestic business to
'incentive regulation', by applying an 'inflation minus 4 percentage points'
formula to domestic pricing of services.
However, an agreement by Hongkong Telecom to cut its international telecom
rates by 12 per cent over three years has captured the Hong Kong stock
market's imagination.
The price reduction in the first year will be 8 per cent, followed by a 2
per cent cut in each of the following two years.
These changes are unlikely to come into effect until early next year because
laws must be amended first. The delay may insulate this year's earnings, but
further on it will have a negative impact.
'The company is in for a period of much slower earnings growth,' said Mr
Andrew Harrington, a member of Salomon Brothers' global telecoms team.
He said the government's statement that it would look again at Hongkong
Telecom's international pricing in three years meant there was still
uncertainty over the company's share price.
This was denied by the company. Mr John Tonroe, finance director, said the
company believed any uncertainty over regulation was now out of the way. He
did, however, agree that Hongkong Telecom's profits would be hit.
The problem with Hongkong Telecom is that it is already one of the world's
cheapest carriers. So although in the US and Europe there might be big
volume gains from price cuts in Hong Kong, those gains might be smaller and
take a longer time to show through.
The accompanying chart gives three scenarios showing the effect of faster or
slower growth in volumes as a result of the price cuts. It assumes the price
reductions will not be introduced until next April.
