FT  02 AUG 94 / Italian birth rate shrinks
Italians risk becoming a vanishing race if current demographic trends
continue. In 1993 Italy registered a 'birth deficit', with deaths
outnumbering the newly born for the first time this century outside the
first world war. According to Istat, the national statistics institute, the
number of births fell to 538,168 - the lowest level since the unification of
Italy. In contrast, the number of deaths rose to 543,433. Compared to 1992,
the birth rate fell from 9.9 to 9.4 per 1,000. If the present trend
continues, one recent research paper suggests Italy's population could fall
from 57m to 12m by the year 2100. However, the south continues to be
prolific and its baby 'surplus' almost compensates for the 'deficit' in the
centre and north. Increased wealth is the main explanation for the decline.
But unlike northern European countries, Italy does not possess an immigrant
population with a high birth rate.
