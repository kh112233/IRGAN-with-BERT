FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland calls for radical CAP
reform
Poland's agriculture minister, Mr Andrzej Smietanko, stressed in talks with
his British counterpart, Mr William Waldegrave, yesterday that Poland wants
to see radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which would allow it
to join the European Union.
'The same policy simply can't be extended to Poland because the EU can't
afford it and Poland doesn't have the resources to pay,' he said.
The Polish minister's comments are likely to add to the current debate in
the EU about whether the CAP can be extended to east European countries.
Mr Smietanko called for greater access for Poland to lucrative EU markets.
'We want access to markets in the EU: we don't just see the till box from
which to draw money,' he said.
The minister pointed out that 1kg of beef sells for the equivalent of 80
cents in Poland, compared with Dollars 2 in the EU.
But cheaper Polish producers were not being allowed to supply products to
the EU market, he said, in spite of declarations by politicians that the
market would be opened to them.
'Unfortunately, we have become net importers of food following the invasion
of EU products,' Mr Smietanko said.
He has highlighted three areas of Polish agriculture as priorities for
reform - these qualify for preferential credit terms from the government and
banks.
The first step is to boost milk production to meet domestic needs following
a 40 per cent drop in output in the past four years. 'We want to build up
those sectors where we have a chance of exporting to the world market,'
Smietanko said.
Mr Smietanko and Mr Waldegrave agreed to set up a working party to tackle
bureaucratic barriers to British investment in Poland.
