FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (17): Daunting burden of development
 -Tough social problems loom
'WE ALL, whites and blacks, think we're entitled to Swedish social security,
but with Polish GDP. It won't work like that,' says Mr John Kane-Berman,
director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, highlighting the
most daunting problem of the post-apartheid era: how to meet the enormous
economic expectations raised by the prospect of black rule.
For any new government will immediately face one grim truth: that South
Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards
overnight to white levels, and there is no explosion of economic growth on
the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs.
South Africa's under-educated population lacks the skills needed for
economic revolution along Far Eastern lines. And over the next generation,
the sheer weight of numbers will depress efforts at economic upliftment: by
2010, South Africa's 1980 population of 29.1m will have nearly doubled to
59.7m, according to the Urban Foundation, a business-funded policy
institute.
It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task
of housing, educating and employing nearly 60m people. Black South Africans
may well find that life remains a struggle.
The first post-apartheid government will inherit a country where, in the
words of the authoritative Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and
Development in Southern Africa, published in 1989, 'poverty is deep and
widespread and . . . the degree of inequality is as great as in any other
country in the world.' For a nation so advanced - the World Bank classifies
it as an upper middle-income developing country - the extent of poverty is
striking.
The charity Operation Hunger feeds 1.8m people daily, victims of the
three-year recession and this year's catastrophic drought. In 1989, 40 per
cent of the population (excluding the nominally independent homelands where
poverty is rife) is estimated to have lived below the so-called 'minimum
living level' or poverty line. A recent IMF report* notes that in terms of
social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality 'black South
Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite
its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy'.
The gap between white and black incomes further emphasises black
deprivation: according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa, though
black incomes have risen more than white incomes in recent years, the white
share of total personal income was 54 per cent in 1988 (whites are 13 per
cent of the population) while blacks representing nearly 80 per cent of the
population had a 36 per cent share.
Apartheid has ensured that state spending on social services is similarly
skewed. According to the IMF, government spent R4,087 per capita educating
whites in 1990, and only R907 on blacks, R2,406 for coloureds and R3,055 for
Asians. Pensions, which are a principal source of income for the poorest
South Africans, are also unequal: whites get a R345 monthly payment, blacks
R293. Health spending is also distorted. And while whites are all at least
decently housed - South African cities boast some of the world's most
luxurious suburbs on earth - over more than 7m non-whites live in informal
urban dwellings such as shacks.
Racial disparities in social spending have narrowed substantially in recent
years, and the government has devoted an extra R3bn of extra-budgetary funds
for special education and housing projects. But the cost of introducing per
capita parity between races would be extremely high. The IMF report states:
'Equalising spending levels at the present white level would result in an
overall level of social spending dramatically beyond the capacity of the
budget.'
It notes that overall spending on education and health (though not on
pensions) is already high in relation to GDP: indeed, education spending, as
a share of the budget and of GDP, substantially exceeded not only that of
middle-income countries, but also industrial nations.
Abolishing the senseless duplications of apartheid would generate some
savings: the new South Africa will not need 15 racially-based departments of
finance, 15 education departments and 14 health ministries, complete with
Mercedes-driving ministers in each one. But the cost of reincorporation is
likely to exceed any savings: to raise per capita socio-economic spending on
homeland blacks to the level which prevails in the Republic would mean a 38
per cent overall increase. And given that independence governments elsewhere
in Africa have tended to increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it, there
seems little chance that bloated homeland civil services or central
government will be streamlined.
The IMF report concludes: 'The scope for further compressing non-social
spending (eg defence) . . . is limited and therefore implies that social
expenditures will need to be re-ordered if the budget is to attend to the
needs of the least privileged groups of society without significant resort
to deficit financing or to higher taxes.' What this means in practice,
according to minister of (black) education and training, Sam de Beer, is
that if South Africa continues to spend 6 per cent of GDP on education
(assuming 3 per cent overall economic growth and a 1:32 pupil/teacher
ratio), government will be able to finance only seven years of compulsory
education by 2000.
The inevitable conclusion is the one drawn by the late Mr Simon Brand,
formerly Development Bank chairman: 'We don't have the resources for the
kind of welfare state we have been running for whites.'
Substantially increasing taxes to fund greater social spending on blacks
would be counter-productive, the IMF argues: 'The tax burden on the white
community appears to be relatively high even by industrial country
standards. This would argue against raising tax rates in South Africa and
running the risk of heightening disincentive effects.'
The IMF concludes: 'Redistribution policies will need to be firmly supported
by growth-orientated policies if the social spending gap is to be
effectively bridged.'
For without economic growth, very little progress can be made toward a more
economically just society.
Yet sustaining growth at the 3.5 per cent required for what the IMF calls a
'meaningful increase in living standards' - during a period of great
political and social turmoil - could well prove a tall order.* Economic
