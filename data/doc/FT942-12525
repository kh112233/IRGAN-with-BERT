FT  29 APR 94 / Directors set out business manifesto
The Institute of Directors yesterday launched a 'business leaders'
manifesto' for the European elections calling for a wholesale reform of the
European Union's political structure, Jenny Luesby writes.
The IoD argues that the structure has led to a proliferation of regulations
that have held back European businesses.
The European Commission is responsible for initiating EU legislation but is
both undemocratic and unaccountable in that it is a bureaucracy rather than
an elected body, the IoD says. As a result it has 'every incentive to become
an activist lawmaker' without needing to consider the costs to Europeans of
that legislation.
Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers, which has the ultimate say on what
should become law, has little control over policy direction.
The IoD says the effect of this structure has been that the impetus in the
EU 'has been towards centralisation, harmonisation and adoption of the
highest-cost solution to economic and social problems'.
It adds: 'Investment, time and money have been diverted from profitable
business activities to regulatory compliance hampering the competitiveness
and dynamism of the European economy.' It estimates the costs of complying
with regulations at more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product.
