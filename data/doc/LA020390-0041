RETRIEVING UNWANTED CHRISTMAS TREES 
Our mission was a relatively simple one: retrieve discarded Christmas trees and 
bring them to nearby Balboa Park where the Los Angeles City Bureau of 
Sanitation was sponsoring a tree recycling program to turn used trees into 
compost and mulch. These trees would once again breathe life into the soil. 
What we didn't anticipate in undertaking this environmental task was the 
abundance of waste, the sheer number of trees simply thrown away with 
Thursday's garbage, not to mention the unknown number of trees gone unsold and 
dumped. So we worked like little elves in the night -- driving through dimly 
lit neighborhoods, immediately spotting any green "lump" and throwing it into 
our truck. 
Our merry band of "thieves" -- stealing from the ditch and giving to the earth 
-- quickly became known as "the Tree Patrol." Our motto: "A tree is a terrible 
thing to waste." Until next year . . .
