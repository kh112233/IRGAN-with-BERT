FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Louis Vuitton introduces
rationing
Louis Vuitton, the French luxury luggage manufacturer, is rationing
customers to one or two purchases at a time because of a surge in demand for
its products, Mr Yves Carcelle, chairman, said yesterday.
The company, part of the LVMH group, saw sales of more than FFr5bn (Dollars
890m) last year - an increase of more than 20 per cent on the year before.
New factories are under construction to meet the demand, which is
particularly strong from Japanese customers who buy up to half of the 2m
exclusive items a year.
The rationing means that customers visiting any of Louis Vuitton's 175 shops
around the world are being told politely they can only buy one or, for some
lines, two of an item.
Handbags are typically priced at Pounds 250-Pounds 400, while cabin trunks
are upwards of Pounds 4,000 (Dollars 6,080) apiece.
The rationing harks back to bullish era of the mid-1980s when Chanel, the
Paris fashion house, faced so much demand from Japanese tourists for its
classic quilted leather handbags that it limited them to one bag each. One
group of tourists was caught trying to bribe passers-by outside Chanel's
flagship store on Rue Cambon in Paris to persuade them to go in and buy more
bags from them.
