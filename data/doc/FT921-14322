FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham warns on electricity -
Energy committee
THE 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales may be breaking
the rules of the new electricity market, Mr John Wakeham told the Commons
energy committee yesterday.
The energy secretary said that if any of the regional companies were found
to be buying electricity above market prices, they would be investigated by
the electricity watchdog, Offer.
The committee meeting, which was considering the consequences of electricity
privatisation, asked Mr Wakeham whether the many new gas-fired power
stations being built would really create more competition.
Because the regional electricity companies have equity stakes in many of the
new projects, suggested committee member Mr Peter Rost (C Erewash), they
might take their power at above market prices and then pass the cost on to
captive domestic consumers.
Mr Wakeham said the regional companies could not do that without breaking
their licences, which oblige them to buy power economically.
British Coal, he pointed out, had told an earlier meeting of the committee
that the new stations would produce power at 2.9p a unit, compared with the
2.2p cost of power from existing coal-fired stations.
If that were true, Mr Wakeham said, then Offer would have to investigate the
regional companies.
However, several regional electricity companies yesterday rejected British
Coal's figures, and the implication that their gas projects were
uncompetitive.
'It's utter rubbish,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands
Electricity, which has a stake in the big gas-fired station being built on
Teesside.
His company's power purchasing policy was not influenced by its investment
in gas stations, he said.
Those stations would be more likely to produce power at about 2.4p than
2.9p, while British Coal's 2.2p figure was unrecognisably low.
