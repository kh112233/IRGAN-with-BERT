FT  16 DEC 94 / Child health 'improving'
Big improvements in health, education and welfare mean that child mortality
in the developing world should fall by about 2.5m next year compared with
1990. The findings, in the latest review by the United Nations World
Children's Fund*, show that more than half the world's developing nations
are set to meet the ambitious targets put forward at the World Summit for
Children in 1990. The biggest advance has come in disorders involving iodine
deficiency, the world's single biggest cause of preventable mental
retardation. Almost 60 of the 94 affected countries are meeting the targets
to tackle iodine deficiency set in 1990, while a further 32 nations could do
so over the next 12 months. Substantial progress has been made in
eradicating polio, while deaths from measles, diarrhoea and pneumonia have
fallen abruptly.
