FT  27 MAY 94 / Sanctuary for whales in Antarctica agreed
The International Whaling Commission yesterday approved a whale sanctuary
around Antarctica that will protect the vast majority of the world's whales
from commercial hunting for the indefinite future.
The sanctuary will stretch from Antarctica to between 40 and 60 degrees
south of the equator. It was first proposed by France two years ago, and
after modifications, was backed by the necessary three-quarters of countries
in the Whaling Commission. Japan had led opposition to the plan.
There were 23 votes in favour, one vote against (Japan) and six abstentions,
including Norway. 'Today is a great day for people who love whales and above
all for the whales themselves,' said Mr Homero Aridjis, head of Grupo de los
Cien, an environmental group in Mexico.
Initially the sanctuary will have only a symbolic impact, since commercial
whale hunting is currently prohibited by an international moratorium.
However environmentalists worry that the International Whaling Commission
may eventually replace the moratorium with hunting quotas for whales that
are not in short supply. If adopted, quotas would have let Japan kill an
estimated 2,000 minke whales a year in the Antarctic region.
Antarctica is home to some 760,000 minke whales, the only whales of
commercial interest in the ocean. Japan has argued that since minke whales
are not endangered, there is no scientific justification for a blanket
sanctuary.
The sanctuary could conceivably make the lifting of the moratorium easier,
since whaling countries can now argue that the vast majority of whales will
be protected from hunters. Japan would like to hunt for minke whales off its
coast, while Norway, in defiance of the moratorium, has already resumed
commercial minke whaling off its shores.
