FT  24 AUG 92 / The week ahead
RESULTS DUE
BRITISH GAS announces its second quarter results tomorrow, the first since
it called for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the UK gas
market.
The share price has slipped slightly on the resulting uncertainty and is
unlikely to be boosted by Tuesday's figures. Expectations range widely, from
a historic cost net loss of Pounds 75m to a Pounds 150m profit, reflecting
forecasting difficulties in the first year of quarterly reporting by British
Gas and a changed year-end from March to December.
Interest centres on the dividend, with the market looking for a signal that
the payout will not be affected by the MMC referral and recent regulatory
changes. Estimates range from 6.4p to 7.7p for the first half, with most
around 6.5p.
WH Smith is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the year to
May 31 of Pounds 110m-Pounds 114m. This will be a healthy increase on the
previous year's Pounds 89m, helped by last summer's rights issue and the
disposal of its loss-making TV division. The retailer is likely to raise its
full-year dividend to 13p or 14p from 12.5p.
Newspaper wholesaling, the subject of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
study launched this past week, has continued to perform strongly. US
operations have been good and UK retailing reasonably resilient. But
Do-It-All, the DIY chain owned jointly with Boots, is likely to have made a
much lower contribution.
Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the UK's five leading composite
(general and life) insurers, is expected to report a cut in pre-tax losses
on Wednesday, underlining the sector's recent improvement. Pre-tax losses
are expected to fall to between Pounds 45m and Pounds 60m compared with an
Pounds 88m deficit at the interim stage last year.
