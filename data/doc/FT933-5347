FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Weak areas fail to hold back
Dutch insurer
INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance company,
reported a solid first-half performance despite the dampening effects of
losses in its reinsurance business and weaker earnings in the non-life
sector.
Net profit advanced to Fl 897m (Dollars 480.9m), representing a rise of 8.9
per cent after adjustments which reflect new accounting principles adopted
in the first quarter.
The group announced an interim dividend of Fl 1.60 per share, on a net
per-share profit of Fl 3.62, and also forecast full-year net earn-ings per
share would at least match the adjusted Fl 7.52 of 1992.
ING said it would take a Fl 400m extraordinary charge for its Orion and
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep units, which would be taken from the Fl 2.5bn
extraordinary provision announced earlier this year.
This charge should be sufficient to cover any losses stemming from claims
against the two units, whose financial results have been excluded from the
consolidated ING results from April 1 1993. Their book value has been
written down to zero.
In reinsurance, ING slipped from a first-half profit of Fl 8m to a loss of
Fl 8m this year. Non-life insurance profits before tax slipped back by over
a third to Fl 37m, but showed signs of improvement relative to the first
quarter.
By far the most powerful engine of growth was the banking division, where
pre-tax earnings pushed ahead by 15 per cent, or Fl 84m, to Fl 634m for the
first half, helped particularly by strong returns from the trading
operations.
ING also posted a strong rise in its life insurance unit, particularly in
the Netherlands, North America and Australia; earnings before tax advanced
by Fl 39m to Fl 329m.
The general insurance operation reported a 7.5 per cent advance to Fl 258m.
