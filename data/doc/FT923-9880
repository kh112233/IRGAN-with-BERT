FT  03 AUG 92 / Jakarta sinks plan to combat piracy
PLANS for an international centre to fight the increasing incidence of
piracy in south-east Asian waters have been scuttled.
The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) had proposed setting up a 24-hour
regional centre in Kuala Lumpur to co-ordinate anti-piracy efforts in waters
off Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. But Indonesia, in
particular, has objected to what it sees as interference in its affairs.
At a Piracy in South-East Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur, Commodore
Sutedjo, director of naval operations and training in the Indonesian navy,
said that as long as piracy occurred within territorial waters, local law
enforcement authorities could carry out counter measures more effectively.
There is alarm at the growing frequency and ferocity of the pirate attacks.
More than 40 incidents have been reported this year in the Strait of Malacca
and in the narrow Phillips channel, off Singapore.
Shipowners say most attacks in the area seem to be carried out by
Indonesians who disappear in the labyrinth of Indonesian islands between
Singapore and Sumatra.
In one incident pirates boarded a supertanker carrying 240,000 tons of crude
oil in the Phillips channel. The crew was tied up and the tanker was left
cruising, unpiloted.
Shipowners have rejected proposals for a toll to keep the region's seas
safe. They say security is the responsibility of the states themselves. It
was reported last week that Indonesia and Singapore had agreed new measures
to combat piracy, including granting each country's marine police and navy
the right of hot pursuit.
