FT  22 OCT 92 / Train damaged in IRA explosion
AN EXPLOSION near a railway track in north London yesterday afternoon
damaged a passing train with flying debris but caused no injury.
Scotland Yard said anti-terrorist officers went to the scene at Silver
Street station, close to the North Circular road.
An hour before the explosion, which happened at about 4.40pm, the IRA in
Dublin issued a statement saying British police had ignored warnings that a
bomb had been left on the rail line in London.
The statement, made just after 3.30pm, accused British officials of
'recklessness' by taking no action over the warnings, said to have been
given to London radio stations.
At that time, Scotland Yard said they had received no such warnings. Forty
minutes later, just before the explosion, British Transport Police said no
security alerts were under way.
British Rail said it had received no advance warning of the blast and Silver
Street station had not been evacuated before the explosion. It confirmed
that the 16.22pm from Cheshunt to Liverpool Street had been caught by the
blast.
It added 'The train is in situ and stationary, having suffered some damage.
There were no injuries.'
