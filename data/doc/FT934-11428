FT  01 NOV 93 / Consumers 'ignored' in energy policy
ENERGY policies have been politically inspired and dominated by producer
interests and short-termism, the Institute of Economic Affairs says in a
study today.
Professor Colin Robinson, professor of economics at the University of
Surrey, says in the study published by the free-market think tank that the
coal and nuclear industries in particular managed to win special treatment
from the state.
'The consumer voice, however, was not heard - or if heard was not heeded,'
says Prof Robinson.
His study also criticises the privatisation of gas and electricity as being
motivated by a desire to raise revenue rather than to introduce competition
into those industries. As a result, the privatised corporations retain huge
amounts of power.
Fuel bills at 12 government departments rose 4 per cent during the year in
spite of official encouragement for energy conservation.
The Cabinet Office's fuel bills rose 10 per cent, according to statistics
compiled by the Association for the Conservation of Energy from published
government sources.
