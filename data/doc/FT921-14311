FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: Under cover
Columbus's voyage of discovery to America seems to have been a relatively
straightforward affair compared with the complications of establishing a
foothold for him in London half a millennium later.
Plans to erect a statue on the Thames Embankment near Lambeth Palace have
been bedevilled by controversy over his actions, which has seen him vilified
as a butcher of indians and plunderer of the environment, not least by
Harold Pinter.
Fortunately, the uproar has failed to deter the Spanish government from
agreeing to fund the project, masterminded by the Hispanic and
Luso-Brazilian Council at Canning House (president Viscount Montgomery of
Alamein).
Even so, the planners are taking no risk of further fuelling anti-Columbus
fervour ahead of the unveiling. They are keeping secret both the location of
the statue - believed to be locked up somewhere in Madrid - and the date
when it will be smuggled into Britain.
