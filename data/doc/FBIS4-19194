<F P=106> [James Blitz report: "Major Backs `Exceptional' Commons </F>
Lies"] 
  [Text] The prime minister has for the first time publicly 
backed a recent claim by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister 
responsible for open government, that ministers can lie to the 
Commons in exceptional circumstances. 
  In a letter to Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham 
North, Mr John Major says: "It is clearly of paramount 
importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information 
to the House." 
  But the prime minister's letter goes on to say: "If they 
knowingly fail to do this, then they should relinquish their 
positions except in the quite exceptional circumstances of which 
a devaluation or time of war or other danger to national 
security have been quoted as examples." 
  The prime minister responded to Mr Radice after he had 
written asking whether it was the duty of ministers not to 
mislead parliament and to resign if they do so. 
  The first exchange of letters followed a statement made by 
Mr 
Waldegrave to the Treasury and civil service select committee, 
of which Mr Radice is a member, that ministers had to lie to the 
Commons in exceptional circumstances. 
  In particular, Mr Waldegrave claimed that Lord Callaghan, 
the 
former Labour prime minister, had told untruths during the 
devaluation crisis of 1967. 
  This has been fiercely denied by Lord Callaghan, who was 
chancellor at the time. He claims that he chose his words on 
the issue very carefully, and that he has never lied to the 
Commons. 
  Until now, the prime minister has given only a guarded 
endorsement of Mr Waldegrave's comments. 
  On a BBC programme in March, Mr Major said: "Mr Waldegrave 
answered an intelligent question frankly about what had happened 
under another government a quarter of a century ago." 
  Asked whether lying could be justified in parliament, he 
said: "Nobody can and nobody does."
