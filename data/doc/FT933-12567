FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Sniffing out the poorly cows - Worth Watching
Bad breath is not just something that affects humans. Scientists at
Southampton and Warwick Universities are developing an 'electronic nose' to
sniff out cows with bad breath, in an attempt to detect early signs of
disease and so improve the health of dairy herds.
The robot nose uses an array of sensors linked to a computer to sniff out
specific smelly molecules. The molecules interact with the sensors to
produce a pattern of responses that the computer can recognise. University
