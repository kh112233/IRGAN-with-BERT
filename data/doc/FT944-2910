FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Accor ready for talks on unit
sale
Accor, the French hotel and restaurant group, said yesterday it hoped to
negotiate this month the sale of a majority stake in its restaurant
concession business to Charterhouse, the UK investment fund.
The total value of Accor's catering business on French highways, airports,
train stations and museums is said to be about FFr1.6bn (Dollars 295.2m).
Charterhouse confirmed last night it hoped to take a stake of 'substantially
more than 50 per cent'.
According to French press reports, Accor is ready to sell up to 80 per cent
of its restaurant concession business for about FFr1.3bn-FFr1.5bn, as part
of the disinvestment programme the French hotel group has embarked on to
reduce its heavy debt.
Accor stressed it would remain 'the industrial operator' of the restaurant
concessions, a statement designed to reassure the public authorities
granting the concessions.
It would keep the same management team so that there would be no decline in
service with the financial entry of the UK investment fund into the
business, Accord said. Charterhouse is controlled by Credit Commercial de
France and its German partner bank, BHF.
