FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Betterware almost doubled to Pounds 13.7m -
Results reflect growth in average orders and doorstep distributors
BETTERWARE, the door-to-door household goods distributor whose army of
10,000 self-employed sales people visit over 1m homes each week, has
reported a 94 per cent jump in full year profits.
For the year ended February 27 1993 the pre-tax balance rose from Pounds
7.04m to Pounds 13.7m; that included Pounds 624,000 exceptional gain
compared with Pounds 322,000 charge. Turnover increased 35 per cent to
Pounds 56.3m (Pounds 41.7m).
Cash flow was again strongly positive boosting year-end net cash balances to
Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 4.5m). Some of this will be used to cover the remaining
cost of the group's new Pounds 9.5m UK distribution centre which is on
target for completion by the end of this year.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said sales in the core home shopping
business, which employs just 170 people, rose by 52 per cent to Pounds
44.7m. The growth reflected a rise in the average customer order from Pounds
7 to Pounds 8 and an increase in the number of doorstep distributors from
7,000 to 10,000.
The current catalogue contains 450 items ranging from can-openers to drain
cleaner 'priced competitively' with high street hardware stores.
Betterware launched a door-to-door sales operation in France 20 months ago
with a scaled down catalogue of 250 items, and was profitable and ahead of
target in its first year after start-up costs of Pounds 250,000; sales
reached Pounds 750,000. Orders are placed by one in four French homes
visited compared to one in five UK and the average order is worth Pounds 13.
Mr Cohen said the early results from the French operations confirmed the
potential for expanding overseas. The group will start up in Spain this year
and has plans to open up in another unidentified European country in the
following 12 months.
Earnings per share grew by 71 per cent to 8.4p (4.9p) and a final dividend
of 1.5p lifts the total to 2p after the scrip issue (equivalent 1.22p).
COMMENT
Betterware's business may not be glamorous, but Andrew Cohen has certainly
proved that his direct sales formulacan continue to deliver profit gains
even during a recession, provided overheads are kept to a bare minimum and
volumes still rise. Higher volumes generated by more local distributors,
shorter catalogue cycles and overseas expansion translate into greater
purchasing power and continuing healthy margins. Despite this there are no
real direct competitors on the horizon and there are significant barriers to
entry. Betterware has the door-to-door sales business down to a fine art.
Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 17m are likely this year and earnings per
share of about 11p imply a lofty prospective p/e of 24 - the share price has
risen more than five-fold in the last two years and could still go higher.
