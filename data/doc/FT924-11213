FT  27 OCT 92 / A bitter pill to swallow: Price constraints threaten to
undermine the sales and earnings of leading drugs companies
The prospect of a victory for Governor Bill Clinton in the US presidential
election has hit US pharmaceuticals stocks. Since the Democratic convention
in July, the shares which were the market's favourites last year have fallen
by more than 10 per cent on average.
The sharp decline has been prompted by fears that a Clinton administration
might introduce controls on drug prices, following the lead of other
countries. Ministries of health in nearly all the largest markets are
planning measures to slow the growth of drugs spending through price cuts or
freezes.
Such pressure threatens to undermine sales and earnings growth, leading
eventually to a restructuring of the world's pharmaceuticals industry.
In August, for the first time, Germany's Krankenkassen - the health
insurance organisations which provide cover for everyone in work - slashed
the amount they were willing to pay for drugs, cutting prices on average by
5 per cent. The reductions, followed by a two-year price freeze, are part of
a package that observers believe could slice drugs groups' profits in
Germany, the world's third-largest market for pharmaceuticals, by a quarter.
In Italy, the world's fourth-largest market, the treasury - which sets drugs
prices - has refused to allow any further increases.
Meanwhile, in Japan, the world's second-largest market, the ministry of
health has cut drugs prices by 8 per cent on average this year. The prices
of some medicines have been reduced nine times in the past 14 years.
But it is in the US, the world's biggest market for pharmaceuticals and one
of the last, with Denmark, in which drug prices are not set by the
government, where the implications of price curbs could be most serious.
Companies are already voluntarily limiting their prices in the hope of
avoiding legislation, but their efforts may be too late to prevent it.
The reason for worldwide pressure on prices is that healthcare budgets in
almost every developed country are out of control. A combination of rising
demand for care from ageing populations and increasingly expensive medical
technology has sent health spending spiralling.
Germany spent about 9 per cent of gross national product on healthcare in
1989 compared with 6 per cent in 1970. Last month, the German health
ministry warned that the Krankenkassen could register a deficit in western
Germany alone of DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) this year because the cost of
healthcare would outstrip contributions.
In the US, healthcare expenditure has risen from 7 per cent of GNP in 1970
to 12 per cent in 1990. Over the same period the proportion of the costs met
by federal and state authorities has increased from 22 per cent to 41 per
cent. The rest is paid by individuals and private health insurers.
Governments, faced with such rising healthcare expenditure, have preferred
to target the prices and volumes of drugs prescribed rather than trim
spending on politically sensitive areas such as hospitals and doctors.
The dilemma is particularly acute in the US where American congressmen
threatened the industry with legislation following the publication in August
of a report by the US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress. The report showed that the price of some drugs (see accompanying
chart) had increased by more than 200 per cent over the past six years,
compared with an overall rise in the consumer price index of 26.2 per cent.
Congressman Pete Stark, Californian Democrat and chairman of the House Ways
and Means health subcommittee, said the report demonstrated there was no
justification for the steep price increases in prescription drugs. He blamed
'corporate greed'.
'The drugs companies are using their monopoly status to make a killing on
very sick people,' he said after the report's publication.
Mr Paul Freiman, chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, says the war of words over prices is partly the reason why
relations between the government and the American pharmaceuticals sector is
at its lowest point for 30 years.
The response from global drugs groups has been defensive. They argue that,
by setting their sights on prices, governments are aiming at the wrong
target.
'Expanding healthcare budgets are not a drug-driven phenomenon. In the UK,
the proportion of health expenditure represented by drugs has only risen
from 9 per cent in 1960 to 10 per cent in 1990,' says Mr Jim Attridge,
international business operations manager at ICI's pharmaceuticals division.
'That isn't much of an increase.'
Expenditure on drugs accounted for 14 per cent of total US healthcare costs
in 1960, according to Mr Peter Lauper, head of pharma-economics at
Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland. By last year the proportion was down to 7 per
cent, although overall spending on drugs was up. Over the same period, much
of the rise in healthcare spending was generated by the cost of running
hospitals and doctors' surgeries. Mr Lauper says expenditure on hospital
staff and other costs represented 34 per cent of healthcare spending in the
US in 1960, and had reached 45 per cent in 1990.
Nevertheless, drugs companies admit their case is not helped by their
traditionally high profit margins and returns on capital. At Glaxo,
worldwide pre-tax profit margins were 31.4 per cent last year, while those
of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer products
company, were 25.6 per cent. Merck, the US giant and the world's largest
drugs group, had margins last year of 36.8 per cent.
During the fatter years of the late 1980s, such pre-tax margins attracted
little attention. But while other industries' earnings have plunged during
the current recession, those of the pharmaceuticals groups have been
conspicuous by their strength.
The industry defends its profits by arguing it needs to invest in research
and development. American groups, for example, now spend about Dollars 11bn
a year researching and bringing new drugs to market, compared with Dollars
4.5bn five years ago.
Many diseases still have no cure, ranging from Aids to Alzheimer's. Given
adequate resources, the industry claims, it can find them. More than 90 per
cent of medicine discoveries are developed by the drugs industry, according
to the US pharmaceutical manufacturers association. American companies
discovered 47 of the top 97-selling drugs launched between 1975 and 1889.
Countries with lower prices and profit margins, such as France, do not
develop best-selling medicines because they do not earn enough to plough
into R&amp;D, the US industry alleges.
One snag with this argument is that the industry's high margins are
calculated after the costs of R&amp;D have been deducted. In other words, the
substantial profits achieved by most of the industry are banked after
companies have met their R&amp;D expenses. If they did not spend as much on R&amp;D,
their profits would be greater.
American politicians have so far been unimpressed by voluntary undertakings
by the industry to control its prices. Merck, Upjohn, Hoechst-Roussel,
Bristol Myers Squibb, ICI and Pfizer have all introduced measures holding
down some or all of their prices. So far, companies supplying a third of the
US market have promised to keep price rises in line with the consumer price
index, according to the industry association.
In spite of such undertakings, global pressure on pricing is unlikely to
disappear. The ensuing structural change, according to Mr Viren Mehta,
partner at Mehta and Isalay, the New-York healthcare investment group, is
producing 'a bifurcation of the industry between the haves and the
have-nots'.
The haves, according to Mr Mehta, are those companies with development
departments which have the expertise and scale necessary to bring drugs to
market quickly in the US, Europe and Japan. They also have strong marketing
skills to exploit the new medicines to the full. He describes them as M&amp;D -
marketing and development - groups. Among them, he lists Merck and Pfizer of
the US, and Glaxo of the UK.
The have-nots are those groups with few new products and expiring patents.
These weaker groups, which used to generate profit growth through price
increases, have been particularly hard hit by the recent pricing
constraints.
In the third quarter of this year, for example, the US group Bristol Myers
Squibb reported pre-tax profits growth of 5 per cent, while Upjohn's
increase was only 1.4 per cent. Eli Lilly recorded a loss of Dollars 268.5m
after restructuring charges. In contrast, Merck, one of the 'haves',
increased earnings by 17 per cent.
The polarisation of the industry could be followed by consolidation among
the have-nots. Mr Martyn Postle, a pharmaceuticals industry consultant at
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management consultancy group, says: 'In 1989 the top
25 companies had about 50 per cent of world pharmaceuticals sales. By the
end of the decade the top 15 groups will control half of the market.'
Economies of scale among the leading M&amp;D groups would allow them to reduce
the proportion of turnover spent on marketing and R&amp;D. Mr Paul Krikler,
industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, the stockbroker, says leading companies
could reduce their sales and general administration costs to about 25 per
cent of turnover - Glaxo currently spends about 40 per cent of turnover on
sales and administration.
Further costs could be saved through the rationalisation of pharmaceuticals
manufacturing, an area of significant over-capacity. Drugs groups have
duplicated manufacturing plants, particularly in European countries, where
they have used the promise of local investment to negotiate higher drugs
prices from governments. Glaxo has manufacturing capacity in 42 sites in 31
countries.
The cost-cutting has already started. Last week, Eli Lilly said it was
spending Dollars 519.6m on restructuring its operations, including
manufacturing. Syntex, a US group, also announced a restructuring plan
during the same week.
Through such cost-containment, some of the larger groups may become stronger
global competitors. But for the weaker companies, the trend towards
government-imposed price constraints in the world's main markets threatens
their survival.
