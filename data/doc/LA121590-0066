OZONE HOLE CLOSING LATE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF ANTARCTIC WIND PATTERNS 
With spring arriving in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic ozone hole is 
closing for the season, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
scientists reported Friday. 
The hole is filling in late this year, said Samuel B. Oltmans of the agency's 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. 
The delay was caused by a circle of persistent winds surrounding the Antarctic 
continent, which prevented air there from mixing with the atmosphere from other 
regions, officials said. 
The agency reported that ozone levels over Antarctica climbed to 220 dobson 
units on Dec. 6 and to 270 units by Dec. 10, according to measurements made by 
instruments carried aloft by balloons. Ozone over the South Pole reached a low 
of 130 dobson units in early October, only marginally above the record low 
measured in 1987. 
That thinning of the layer is sometimes referred to as a hole, although it 
amounts to somewhat less than half of the normal ozone level of over 300 units 
in that part of the world. 
Ozone is vital in the upper atmosphere, where it blocks some of the hazardous 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. A reduction in ozone could lead to damage 
to crops and animal life and to an increase in skin cancer among humans, some 
scientists warn. 
The dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how much of each of 
two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed by the air. That ratio changes 
depending on the concentration of ozone.
