FT  07 OCT 92 / Czech and Slovak split back on course
CZECH AND Slovak political leaders yesterday agreed to continue working
toward the division of the Czechoslovak federal state, defusing the
political crisis brought about by the recent Slovak about-face.
After eight hours of negotiations late last night, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
Czech prime minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, issued
a joint statement.
They confirmed earlier agreements which aim to create two independent Czech
and Slovak republics by next January 1.
The statement calmed mounting fears that the country was heading toward
political paralysis, with both Czech and Slovak leaders standing at opposite
ends as regards the fate of the federal state.
In a surprise move in the federal parliament last Thursday night, Slovak
nationalists had succeeded, with the support of the Czech opposition
parties, in pushing through a motion to draw up plans for a new union
between the Slovak and Czech republics.
Such a possibility has always been categorically rejected by Mr Klaus.
However, Mr Meciar and his party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS), last night went back on its proposal for a union.
'The HZDS respects the idea that it is impossible to transform the current
federation into a confederation or a union,' the statement said.
Difficult compromises remain to be reached, though, over the practical
aspects of the divorce.
So far no agreements have appeared over the methods to be used in dividing
federal properties.
The Czech side is refusing to accept the financial compensations requested
by Slovak negotiators.
