FT  23 NOV 94 / Beijing and Hanoi aim to settle differences over Spratlys
China and Vietnam agreed yesterday to work peacefully to resolve their
disputes over territorial and maritime boundaries, and are to set up a group
of experts to discuss their rival claims to the Spratly atolls and the
waters of the South China Sea.
A joint communique released at the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by
China's President Jiang Zemin said the two governments agreed to 'refrain
from all acts that make things more complicated or broaden conflicts'.
The dispute over the South China Sea is especially sensitive, because each
country is seeking to exploit oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the
sea bed. Both countries have awarded oil exploration contracts to US oil
companies in disputed waters.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said in the Vietnamese capital
Hanoi the two sides could shelve disputes and start 'joint development' if
problems could not be resolved in talks immediately.
Joint development of possible oil and gas fields in disputed maritime areas
is a proven method of overcoming conflicts between two countries, but might
not succeed in all areas of the sea because there are four other claimants
to some or all of the islands: Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in the past few years. But
Vietnamese officials say China has recently encroached on their territory
near the border, refused to open a railway link to allow normal trade across
the land frontier, and let Chinese traders smuggle cheap Chinese goods into
Vietnam.
Mr Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese president, may not have brought
much in the way of concrete achievements, but suggests the two governments
want to set aside their differences and concentrate on the similar
challenges each faces: keeping their one-party communist political systems
intact while liberalising the economy.
