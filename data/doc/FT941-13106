FT  27 JAN 94 / Poorest rely on benefit cash: Self-employed face hardship -
Disposable income rises
The least well-off 20 per cent of the population in 1990-91 derived 69 per
cent of their income from benefits, with only 20 per cent coming from
employment. Earnings from employment provided 75 per cent of the income of
the remaining four-fifths of the population, with benefits providing 11 per
cent.
These are among the findings of a study of Britain's lowest-income
households, presented in a special article in Social Trends by Mr Nick
Adkin, a statistician at the Department of Social Security.
More than a quarter of the poorest group at the time of the study was
retired. When they are added to others who were not working - either because
they were unemployed, non-working single parents or people with long-term
illnesses - people without work made up almost 70 per cent of the poorest
group. Only about a quarter of the group had worked a full year, compared
with 70 per cent of the rest of the population.
After housing costs, the real income of the poorest 20 per cent fell about 3
per cent between 1979 and 1990-91. Real incomes of all other groups
increased, with the wealthiest fifth of the population achieving a 49 per
cent rise.
The largest single group in the poorest 20 per cent is couples with
children, although they are represented in broad proportion to their numbers
in the population as a whole. This is not so with single parents - they make
up 15 per cent of the poorest group, but only 4 per cent of the rest of the
population. Mr Adkin links this firmly to their economic circumstances, with
only about 4 per cent of the poorest single parents in full-time work.
Two-thirds of the 3m children in the poorest group lived in families that
did not contain a full-time worker, compared with 11 per cent of children in
the rest of the population.
One striking finding is that the full-time self-employed make up 10 per cent
of the poorest group - similar to their proportion in the rest of the
population. The problem of accurately measuring income of the self-employed,
according to Mr Adkin, has 'vexed researchers for some time', and it is
unclear to what extent this may reflect some self-employed people
under-declaring their income or other factors.
Real disposable household income per head rose between 1991 and 1992,
reversing a fall the previous year, and is now at its highest level - nearly
80 per cent above 1971, says Social Trends.
