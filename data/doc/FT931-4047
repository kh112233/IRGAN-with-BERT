FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Yen for pound helps Foreign &amp; Colonial net
assets advance
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust celebrated its 125th anniversary by
raising its final dividend by 5.2 per cent - the 22nd consecutive annual
increase.
The trust, the UK's largest, increased net assets by 22 per cent in 1992,
compared to a 15 per cent rise in the FT-A All-Share Index.
Net assets per share were 225.5p (184.7p) at the end of the year, making the
consolidated net assets Pounds 1.18bn.
Mr Michael Hart, joint manager of the trust, said that the performance was
helped by the decision to switch yen borrowings into sterling before the
pound's departure from the exchange rate mechanism.
Stock selection was also successful, with BAT and Home Depot performing
particularly well.
However, the group's move into Japanese equities has yet to bear fruit and
it was underexposed to Hong Kong last year.
Mr Hart said he thought the FT-SE 100 Index would reach 3100 by the end of
the year, as UK corporate profits benefited from rationalisation, lower
interest rates and devaluation.
At the end of the year, the portfolio was split, in asset terms: UK (40 per
cent); Europe (15 per cent); US (30 per cent); Japan (9 per cent); Far East
(4 per cent) and Latin America (2 per cent).
The number of individual shareholders increased to 56,751 by the end of 1992
and 58,131 by the end of February 1993.
Private investors now own 39 per cent of the trust, compared with 24 per
cent at the end of 1986.
The recommended final dividend is 2.23p, making a total of 3.35p (3.19p). A
further Pounds 1m was added to revenue reserves.
