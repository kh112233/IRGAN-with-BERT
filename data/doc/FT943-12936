FT  22 JUL 94 / D-Day events boost tourism earnings
This summer's D-Day commemoration may have increased Britain's tourism
earnings from North America by as much as Pounds 73m, according to Mr Iain
Sproat, national heritage minister.
He said in a Commons written answer that early indications suggested the
event had attracted between 75,000 and 125,000 extra North American visitors
to the UK.
This had increased the country's earnings from tourism by 'between Pounds
44m and Pounds 73m', he said.
Both the number of visitors and the amount of visitor spending were
'substantially' higher than forecast.
Earlier this year, Mr John Major was forced to defuse an embarrassing row
over the nature of the 50th anniversary commemoration by bowing to veterans'
demands for a bigger say in the events. There had been widespread criticism
of the national heritage department's handling of the anniversary.
