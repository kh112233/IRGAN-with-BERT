  The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office (OCEI) 
reported on 29 December that unemployment in Venezuela at the 
end of 1993 was 6.6 percent, while the so-called "informal 
sector" of the economy grew by 116,700 jobs and employed 40.8 
percent of the working population. OCEI also reported that the 
economically active population totals 7,582,345; 93.4 percent 
were employed during the second half of 1993. It added that the 
government eliminated 65,000 jobs and employed 1,198,611

  Energy and Mines Minister Alirio Parra said the state budget 
for PDVSA (Venezuelan Petroleum) for 1994 is 1.065 trillion 
bolivares, based on a price per barrel of oil of $13.50. 
Profits are expected to be approximately $12 billion. He added 
that 1994 exports will be 2.23 million barrels per day and that 
the operational objectives of the budget aim at increasing the 
country's reserves by 172 million barrels through exploration of 
new areas. Regarding PDVSA's affiliates abroad, the minister 
said they should net $142 million with an investment of $536 
million. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL In Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 2-6) 
  The BCV reported on 2 January that Venezuela's international 
reserves dropped $324 million during 1993, closing the year at 
$12.677 billion. However, the reduction of international 
reserves in 1993 was still less than the reduction registered in 
1992 when they dropped $1.104 billion. In December 1993 
Venezuela's international reserves increased $261 million.

  The BCV reported on 3 January that 1993 inflation was 45.9 
percent, the second highest in 35 years, surpassed only by the 
81 percent inflation rate registered in 1989. The BCV added 
that in December prices increased 3.6 percent. The state bank 
also reported that implementation of the value-added tax in 
October caused the inflation rate of December to increase 0.4 
percent, less than the 0.6 percent November increase. Inflation 
in 1993 surpassed the 1992 rate -- 31.9 percent -- by 14 points; 
it is expected that in 1994 it will drop and remain between 35 
percent and 40 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2124 GMT 3 Jan
