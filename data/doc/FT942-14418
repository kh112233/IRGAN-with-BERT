FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Xerox in digital printing move
Xerox, the US document processing company, yesterday announced plans to step
up its assault on the conventional printing market with a series of products
and industrial alliances aimed at encouraging the digital transmission and
printing of documents.
The group intends to capture a big slice of the markets created as
electronic technology is increasingly used for printing business and other
documents. Xerox said the segment of the offset printing market (in which
metal plates and ink are used) which could switch to digital methods
totalled about Dollars 93bn worldwide.
'Today, you can pick up a telephone anywhere and reach anywhere,' said Mr
Peter van Cuylenberg, Xerox executive vice-president. 'It should be the same
with documents and publications.'
Xerox announced:
New software called DocuSP to integrate document services from printers,
personal computers, scanners and storage devices.
Xerox said this would eventually make integration of document processing
equipment as easy as plugging in a telephone;
A new grouping of more than 50 information technology companies to speed up
the development of new systems, open to all suppliers, and applications for
electronic publishing on demand to save time and distribution costs.
This alliance includes AT&amp;T, Sun Microsystems and Novell;
High-speed document printers and scanners for easier printing of documents
manuals, educational books and other texts, with specific groups of users
which form the market for digital printing.
