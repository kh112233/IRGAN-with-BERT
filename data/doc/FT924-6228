FT  23 NOV 92 / Demirel aims to win better hearing on EC for Turkey
TURKISH leader Suleyman Demirel takes his campaign for Turkey's membership
of the European Community to London today amid signs that Turkey's
conservative-led coalition is increasingly out of step with public opinion
on Europe.
During talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, Mr Demirel will make the case
that Turkey deserves a better hearing, and that its value to the west has
become all the more vital given the political turmoil in the region.
Mr Demirel has been quick to emphasise that Turkey's recent moves to bolster
ties with both Black Sea and Central Asian states is no alternative to EC
membership.
In Rome last week Turkey signed up as an associate member of the Western
European Union. However Ankara remains anxious that this 10-nation defence
organisation should not replace Nato as the centrepiece of European defence.
At the Turkey-EC association council earlier this month, both sides endorsed
the idea of greater political dialogue. In turning down Turkey's application
for membership in 1989, the Commission emphasised deficiencies in Turkey's
level of economic development, on human rights and on lack of progress on
Cyprus. As one EC ambassador pointed out, the enhanced relationship now
requires that the Turks address these issues with even more urgency,
particularly on questions like the Kurds.
In his address to the Confederation of British industry today, Mr Demirel
will outline Turkey's commitment to customs union. From January 1 1993,
Turkey will simplify its tariff regime to re-establish the community's
preference, following legislation passed by Ankara in July.
Turkey's accord with the EC envisages eliminating import tariffs by 1996,
and adopting the community's external tariff.
