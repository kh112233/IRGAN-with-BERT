EARNINGS 
Caesars World Inc.: The casino hotel company said first-quarter earnings fell 
23% to $17.5 million. Revenue totaled $225.7 million, down 2% from the same 
period a year ago. The Los Angeles-based company said gambling volume increased 
in all three of its hotel casinos. But those gains were more than offset by 
lower overall win percentages, disruptions from expansion programs in Las 
Vegas, higher marketing and payroll costs and a rise in bad debt provisions.
