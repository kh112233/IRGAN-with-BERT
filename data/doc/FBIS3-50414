  [Excerpts] Bratislava--"By 2 May 1994, the Slovak 
Government will submit to the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague the `Memorandum of the Slovak Republic on the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Hydroelectric Power Project.' We expect the 
document to consist of 2,000-2,500 pages," Jan Lisuch, state 
secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told yesterday's 
meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] 
Commission for Issues of the Danube Hydroelectric Projects. 
  The state secretary also briefed the NRSR commission on 
findings acquired thus far about the impact of the Gabcikovo 
hydroelectric project on the level of underground water in Zitny 
Ostrov [Rye Island, area along the Danube in southern Slovakia], 
on water supply in the system of Danube branches, and on 
improving navigation on the Danube. [passage omitted] 
  At their meeting yesterday, members of the NRSR commission 
also discussed a reply to a letter from Andras Pap, chairman of 
the Hungarian Parliament's committee dealing with the 
hydroelectric project. The reply states that the solution to 
the problem of a sufficient amount of water in the Danube 
branches [on Hungarian territory] lies in the "mutually agreed 
construction of a dam at Dunakiliti. This would make it 
possible to supply the network of branches in the Szigetkoz area 
with up to 140 cubic meters of water per second." Academician 
Juraj Hrasko, chairman of the NRSR commission, stressed that the 
flow in the old river bed [of the Danube] could be increased 
after the completion of an automatic water diversion system at a 
newly built small hydroelectric power plant [at Dunakiliti]. 
This pledge [to increase flow in the old riverbed] would mean a 
reduction in the production of electricity in Gabcikovo by about 
28 million kilowatt-hours annually, which would extend the 
period necessary for the investment costs to be recouped. "On no 
account will the Slovak side consider this temporary solution to 
be a retreat from positions during the discussion of the 
Slovak-Hungarian dispute before the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. The failure to implement solutions, the 
blueprints of which are ready and agreement on which had already 
been reached, runs counter to our common interest in the 
creation of optimal conditions for the ecological system of 
Danube wetland forests," the reply from the NRSR commission to 
Andras Pap's letter states.
