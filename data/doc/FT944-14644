FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelter in Dollars 280m
upgrade
Russia's Novokutsnetsk aluminium smelter in Siberia is to be modernised over
the next four to five years with the help of VAW of Germany. The project
will cost about Dollars 280m.
This is the first time a Russian smelter will be fully modernised rather
than partially upgraded, says Mr Horst Peters, managing director of VAW
Aluminium-Technologie. The project will cut pollution from Novokutsnetsk
substantially, improve working conditions and reduce energy use by 20 per
cent.
Novokutsnetsk has two plants, built between 1942 and 1966 with a total
annual capacity of about 280,000 tonnes. The older plant will be permanently
closed and the other's capacity increased to 250,000 tonnes of
higher-quality aluminium.
Conditions for the 150,000 people living near the smelter had become so bad
because of pollution from the older plant's outdated technology that three
of its six buildings have already been taken out of operation.
Mr Peters says the project will be paid for by aluminium exports -
Novokutsnetsk has a licence for 60,000 tonnes of tax-free exports each year
between 1994 and 2000.
Finance is expected to come from supplier loans, private banks and,
possibly, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
VAW has been working on a feasibility study for some time and this assumes
that the aluminium price will average Dollars 1,650 a tonne and calculates
the modernised smelter's production costs at about Dollars 950 a tonne.
The contract to provide engineering services is worth DM20m (Dollars 13m) to
VAW.
