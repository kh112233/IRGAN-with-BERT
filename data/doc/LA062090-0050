CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SUNNYVALE; 
LOCKHEED WORKERS SHOW NO ILLNESS 
There were no reports of Legionnaire's disease among Lockheed Missile &amp; 
Space Co. employees, but two buildings in Sunnyvale where the dreaded bacteria 
surfaced remain closed indefinitely, a spokesman said. 
Discovery of the Legionnaire's bacteria in humidifiers in two company labs 
forced the closure of both buildings on Friday. There was no estimate as to how 
soon they could be reopened, Lockheed spokesman Bob Burgess said. Of 250 
employees who were working in the buildings, 18 saw doctors for examinations, 
but none had any signs of the illness, Burgess said.
