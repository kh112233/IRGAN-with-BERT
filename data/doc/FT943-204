FT  30 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Home, ski home in the Antarctic
Scientists and technicians working for the British Antarctic Survey will
spend the winter in the first mobile house on skis.
The building will house 30 people studying ice, the upper atmosphere and the
climate at the Halley Research Station, the BAS's most remote Antarctic
base. Every year, the ski-borne house will be moved by bulldozers to pull it
free of snow and ice. The skis, which are 19.5m long, are fitted with air
bags which are blown up to crack any ice that accumulates underneath them.
The pre-fabricated house, which was built by VM Fabrications,
Huddersfield-based engineers and Bennett Associates, designers, will replace
tent-style accommodation.
