FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Lloyd's Names should have guarantee of profits
accruing to them
Sir, Messrs David Rowland and Peter Middleton (chairman and chief executive
respectively of Lloyd's) are to be congratulated for admitting frankly that
there has been massive deception, incompetence and worse at Lloyd's over the
last 13 years. No one should be surprised to hear that the only money that
Lloyd's has belongs to the Names and they have no magic cheque book hidden
away ('Lloyd's urges Names to settle grievances through negotiation', May
26). It is a little more worrying to hear that they still have no proper
information on which to manage the business - maybe underwriting should stop
until they do have such information.
They both spent much time explaining how they represented all Names, but if
they really do then they should follow the advice of the EGM2 which follows
on naturally from this statement:
(1) They should put together a package which will subsequently be voted on
by all Names and will require a two-thirds majority to be implemented. (2)
They should give all Names a shared and common interest in building a
profitable future for the society. The only way to do this is to guarantee
that 25 per cent of all future profits will accrue to the current Names
equally. This is a small price for corporate capital to pay for the goodwill
and assets of Lloyd's which belong to current Names and much less than they
would have to pay to set it up from scratch.
The only asset that Lloyd's has left is the goodwill and name of Lloyd's. If
they reckon that it can produce Pounds 900m in 1995 then it is worth around
Pounds 18bn. This money belongs to Names and we must make sure that it is
not given away to their friends. If they do not adopt this position freely
then an EGM to be lodged on Friday will force it upon them. Claud Gurney,
