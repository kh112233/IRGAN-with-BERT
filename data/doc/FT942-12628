FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter result climbs 14%
at BCE
Rising demand for value-added telephone services helped BCE, the Canadian
telecommunications holding company, boost first-quarter earnings by 14 per
cent.
But BCE, Canada's biggest private-sector company, warned yesterday that
regulatory barriers in Canada could slow the convergence of telephone, TV
television and computer technologies, which has become a high priority of
its corporate strategy.
'Investors are increasingly nervous about (the policy and regulatory)
environment,' Mr Red Wilson, chief executive, told the annual meeting in
Toronto. 'They perceive the regulatory framework as being uncertain, the
direction of government policy as being unclear. We need to know which
markets will be open to us as investors in Canada.'
First-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 251m (USDollars 181.8m), or 74 cents
a share, from CDollars 221m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
CDollars 5bn against CDollars 4.73bn.
The bulk of the earnings came from Canadian telecommunications, mainly Bell
Canada, the country's biggest phone company. Bell contributed CDollars 180m
to consolidated earnings, up from CDollars 132m last year.
The performance reflects higher sales of a growing array of optional phone
services, growth of network access services, and payments from long-distance
competitors for access to local networks.
BCE's other interests include a 53 per cent stake in Northern Telecom, the
telephone equipment maker; 20 per cent of Mercury, the UK telephone company;
and 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a US-based cable-TV operator.
