  [Abstract] The danger of uncontrollable exposure of humans 
to ionizing radiation due to, e.g., nuclear accidents, and the 
shortcomings of existing natural and synthetic polymer drugs 
administered for radiation sickness, such as side effects, 
prompted continued search for compounds with a therapeutic 
antiactinic action which are free of this drawback. To this end, 
the anti-actinic and other biological properties of the 
2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine and N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer 
(sovidon) are investigated in order to assess the outlook for 
its applications as a means of early acute radiation sickness 
treatment. The experiment was carried out on 20-24 g noninbred 
white hybrid mice (CBAxC57B1)F[.sub]1[/], 60-80 g hamsters, 
180-220 g rats, 280-350 g guinea pigs, 11-17 kg noninbred dogs, 
large 25-35 kg Romanov breed sheep, and Macaca 
fascicularis monkeys. The animals were exposed to general 
brief 0.5-1.5 Gy/min [.sup]60[/]Co irradiation or extended 
0.01 Gy/min [.sup]137[/]Cs irradiation. The copolymer was 
intramuscularly administered in the form of a 10% 
solution, and 
the modification of biological factors was monitored. The 
antiactinic therapeutic efficacy of sovidon--the copolymer 
developed by the Kovidon pharmaceutical company--in various 
types of animals at various doses, sovidon's treatment 
efficiency for prolonged irradiation, the tumor development 
rate, the effect of combined use of various antiactinic measures 
on the outcome of radiation injury in dogs, and sovidon's 
antiactinic efficiency when using drugs which mitigate its side 
effects are summarized. The findings confirm that given adequate 
experimental verification, sovidon may find applications in 
other branches of medicine (oncology, pulmonology, and 
hematology) or veterinary practices. The authors are grateful to 
B.A. Titov, E.P. Korovkina, P.A. Vlasov, V.N. Izvekov, L.V. 
Bogatov, and L.N. Dubov for assistance with experiments an
