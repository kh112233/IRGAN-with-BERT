FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter (2): East Europe: A 'remarkable lack of vision' shown
by the west
Sir, Edward Mortimer was right to criticise western Europe's failure to
respond to the challenge of events in the east.
A Marshall Plan type of initiative is, of course, needed to help the eastern
Europeans achieve economic and political stability. Such an initiative is
also needed in the interests of western Europeans. Without it, further
disintegration in the east will inevitably lead to mass immigration to the
west.
The success of American companies in Europe owes much of its origins to the
post-second world war Marshall Plan, a combination of brilliant conception
and execution by government in partnership with industry. A concerted and
co-ordinated approach to eastern Europe could lay the foundations of western
 -and indeed global - economic recovery.
To achieve this, the present western leaders must match those earlier
American leaders in their far-sightedness and willingness to take a
long-term view.
