FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (6): Attractions galore - Land and subsidies bring
in the investors
GLASGOW has for the past 10 years been vigorously trying to attract new
businesses. The city on the Clyde urgently needed to replace some of the
thousands of jobs lost in shipbuilding and engineering.
The city has concentrated on building itself up as a service centre based on
retailing, tourism, financial services, scientific research and providing
companies with regional headquarters. It would also like to encourage
manufacturing but has not done as well as a number of other places in
Scotland.
Professor Alan MacGregor, of the social and economic research department at
Glasgow university, says: 'People still think of Glasgow as an industrial
city but it has not been an industrial city for a long time now.
Manufacturing occupies only 16 per cent of the workforce. Apart from
anything else there is not the land available for manufacturing.
'Manufacturers nowadays generally want greenfield sites. There have been
lots of manufacturing companies drawn to places close to Glasgow like East
Kilbride. But in the city itself, like other cities, there is not the room.'
In setting out its stall to attract service companies, Glasgow has a
formidable array of attractions. It is a development area so that companies
qualify for Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) from the Scottish Office
Industry Department.
Through Strathclyde region, Glasgow receives assistance from the European
Social Fund directed at people through training programmes, and from the
European Regional Development Fund which is aimed at infrastructural
improvements. There is also EC money available for former coal and steel
producing areas.
This all amounts to a considerable subsidy to Glasgow, some of which filters
through to individual companies. The Economic Policy Unit of the City
Council estimates that Regional Selective Assistance alone can account for
30 per cent of fixed project costs.
On top of this, much of the work of the Scottish Development Agency, before
its winding up in 1991, was devoted to Glasgow. It offered a range of
practical and financial assistance and was able to build, rent and sell
offices and factories at low cost.
The SDA has now become Scottish Enterprise, which operates through a network
of local enterprise companies of which Glasgow's is the Glasgow Development
Agency. The GDA can still act as an enabling body in the property sector.
As an example the GDA recently bought 35 acres of the land on which the
Glasgow garden festival was held in 1988 at a cost of Pounds 5m. The GDA
will look for a private developer for the land when the property climate
improves. By putting land into a project as a form of equity the GDA can
make the scheme more economical for the developer.
There has been heavy investment in Glasgow's infrastructure. Mr Stephen
Ince, the economic development officer at the City Council, says: 'We
estimate that Pounds 2.4bn is likely to be invested from 1991 and over the
next three or four years, mostly in offices, shops, transportation and
communications.'
Much of the office stock in the city centre has been renewed in the past few
years, and new offices built. The council's economic policy unit claims that
Glasgow's office rents are typically only 35 per cent of those in central
London and Paris, and 50 per cent of the rate in Madrid, Milan and
Frankfurt.
Wages are similarly low, with non-manual male and female wage rates between
only 70 per cent and 74 per cent of the greater London rate. The potential
savings of operating in Glasgow increase because of the high degree of
labour market stability in the city.
The council estimates that annual staff turnover in service industries in
Glasgow is less than 7 per cent, compared with 20 per cent in London and 15
per cent in the south-east of England.
As for high quality staff there are two universities - Glasgow and
Strathclyde - with 8,000 students graduating from these and the polytechnics
and further education colleges each year.
Communications is another important factor influencing relocation decisions.
Here too Glasgow, scores highly. It is relatively free of congestion for a
big city. Glasgow is the only major city with a motorway running through its
centre.
The suburban rail network, underground and bus links form one of the most
comprehensive in Britain. There are inter-city rail connections to all major
UK cities. Glasgow airport is less than 15 minutes from the city centre. It
provides flights to 60 domestic and international destinations including
more than 190 flights a week to London.
Finally the city prides itself on its quality of life. Like many towns and
cities in Britain, Glasgow can claim that employees can live in pleasant
surroundings only a few minutes from work, with no problems parking on
arrival, and get swiftly out into the countryside, compared with the hour or
so it takes to get to work London. Glasgow also sees itself as a
cosmopolitan city with a vibrant cultural life, including concerts, ballet,
opera and restaurants.
With all this, Glasgow has been successful in attracting new service
companies ranging from regional headquarters of financial services groups to
government departments to software systems and engineering.
In spite of this month's decision by BP Exploration to pull out of Glasgow
over the next year or so, the city has attracted 17 concerns involving just
under 7,000 net new jobs between 1986 and 1991 (see table).
Unemployment at 14.5 per cent amounts to just under 60,000 jobs.
Unemployment is traditionally high in Glasgow but these new jobs in services
have made a significant dent in what the overall total might be especially
when taken together with new jobs in tourism.
The table shows that Glasgow is on the way to becoming a second tier
financial services centre.
It has won a fair share of government department relocations and is laying
the basis for a research and development network which can lock into the
universities.
