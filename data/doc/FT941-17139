FT  06 JAN 94 / To ban or not to ban
The Irish cabinet held its first meeting of the new year yesterday without
reaching a final decision on whether to drop the Republic's broadcasting ban
on Sinn Fein - the political wing of the IRA - and other listed
organisations.
Officials said the matter was discussed at the meeting, but no final
decision was taken. The order enshrining the ban is due to expire on January
19.
A broad consensus within the cabinet is understood to favour discarding the
ban.
Any such move would come at a sensitive time, however, and would almost
certainly be criticised by unionists as a concession to the IRA.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is due to report on a review
of British restrictions this month. An early decision to remove them is
unlikely.
