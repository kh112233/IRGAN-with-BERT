FT  11 MAY 91 / No prosecution over rail crash at Cannon St
NO PROSECUTION will be brought in connection with the crash on January 8 at
Cannon Street station in London. Two people were killed and more than 250
injured.
Sir Allan Green, director of public prosecutions, said yesterday there was
'insufficient evidence available to provide a realistic prospect of a
conviction' of the driver or any other person or organisation.
Mr Morris Graham, the driver, said his brakes had failed before the 7.58am
train from Sevenoaks, Kent, crashed into the buffers at the station.
British Rail ruled out brake failure as a cause of the accident.
A public inquiry was told that British Transport Police had failed to secure
the driving cab after the crash to protect evidence of the position of the
controls.
It also heard that parts of some coaches used in the packed commuter train
were more than 60 years old.
