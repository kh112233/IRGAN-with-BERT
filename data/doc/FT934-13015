FT  23 OCT 93 / Week in the Markets: Copper struggles to halt downtrend
THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market was yesterday making yet another
attempt to consolidate after a resumption of the bear trend that followed
the ending of a protracted technical supply 'squeeze' five weeks ago.
At the close the three-months delivery contract, which had earlier slumped
to a six-year low of Dollars 1,630 a tonne, was quoted at Dollars 1,636.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day, Dollars 68 on the week and Dollars 244
from the level ruling before the squeeze suddenly evaporated on September
17.
Most of the fall - Dollars 47 for three-months metal - happened on Monday,
as the market abandoned last week's attempt to consolidate after a modest,
technically inspired rally. Tuesday's extended decline, reflecting bearish
fundamental and technical factors, had dealers talking in terms of an
imminent test of support around the Dollars 1,600-a-tonne area. But another
abortive consolidation interrupted the downtrend on Wednesday and early on
Thursday before running into stern resistance close to Dollars 1,660 a
tonne.
The aluminium market had also steadied at the end of last week, helped by
reports of production problems in the former Soviet Union. But those gains
were quickly wiped out on Monday and the three-months delivery price dipped
to Dollars 1,112 a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,115.25, down
Dollars 27.50 on balance.
The biggest loser, however was nickel. The three months position surrendered
Dollars 130 of last week's Dollars 207.50-a-tonne rise to close yesterday at
Dollars 4,645 a tonne. That fall reflected the further fading of hopes that
other companies would follow up the 16 per cent output cut announcement made
two weeks ago by Canada's Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer. That
move, together with buying in anticipation that it was coming, had been
instrumental in lifting the price from the 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars 4,030
a tonne reached a week earlier.
On the credit side at the LME this week were tin and lead.
Despite easing back by Dollars 48 yesterday the three months tin price
closed with a Dollars 192.50 gain on the week at Dollars 5,005 a tonne. But
that performance owed less to the market's fundamentals than to
manipulation, probably on behalf of producers as well as merchants,
according to Ms Lesley Campbell, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the London broker.
'Most of the recent rise is artificial,' said Ms Campbell, 'the result of a
well-timed, concerted effort to boost the price.'
She explained that the operation, centred on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market,
was well-timed because the market was oversold and nervous after the recent
fall to 20-year lows. In addition the fundamental position had changed as
mines had cut production of concentrates (an intermediate material) over the
past six weeks, although the resulting supply tightness 'could take another
year to filter through and give real support to prices'. In the meantime
availability of refined metal would continue to be assured by the plentiful
supplies in the US official stockpile and LME registered warehouses.
The lead market suffered a heavy fall in the first half of the week before
buyers returned in strength. The three-months position, which had risen by
Pounds 20.75 last week, fell back by Pounds 9.75 a tonne over the first two
days of this week. But it then surged by Pounds 19.25 to close yesterday at
Pounds 414.75 a tonne, the highest level since August 5.
Dealers attributed the rise to trade buying and short-covering encouraged by
the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, the high season for sales of
replacement car batteries.
The gold market ended a choppy week in the middle of its range. After
trading as low as Dollars 364.25 a troy ounce and as high as Dollars 375.20
it closed on the London bullion market yesterday at Dollars 368 an ounce, up
Dollars 3.25 on balance. Once again the market seemed to be dancing to the
tune of the US investment funds - falling when they were sellers and rising
when they bought. Dealers also noted that producers had been active sellers
early in the week.
The silver and platinum markets both fell back with gold yesterday - by 9
cents to Dollars 4.44 1/2 an ounce and by Dollars 4.10 to Dollars 371.75 -
but were still up on the week - by 11 cents and Dollars 5 respectively.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the market was 'disappointed' after
silver's failure on Thursday to breach technical resistance at Dollars 4.60
an ounce. 'It could drift lower over the next couple of weeks,' one said.
At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa market tried its footing on fresh
high ground before deciding reluctantly on a tactical retreat. The March
position reached a 5 1/4 -year high of Pounds 991 a tonne on Thursday,
before easing to Pounds 976 at the end of the day; and yesterday it
clambered back to Pounds 988 a tonne at one point. Vertigo set in once
again, however, and by the close the price stood at Pounds 965 a tonne, up
Pounds 21 on the week.
Dealers said the highs were reached on relatively light buying in what one
called 'a selling vacuum'.
The coffee market moved with the ebb and flow of confidence about Brazil
operating the export retention scheme effectively, especially in view of the
present political scandals. The January position traded up to Dollars 1,242
a tonne in mid-week but ended at Dollars 1,205, up Dollars 13 on balance.
