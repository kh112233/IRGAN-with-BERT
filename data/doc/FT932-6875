FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca bounces
Securities houses involved in the forthcoming Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights
issue were relieved to see a bounce in the shares, which have been drifting
dangerously close to the rights level of 600p a share. The Zeneca ex-rights
price quoted in the official grey market recovered 8 to 630p with 2.4m
dealt, while the nil-paid bounced 6 to 36p on heavy turnover of 3.1m.
Traders said SG Warburg, BZW and Goldman Sachs, the primary underwriters,
were all bidding for stock yesterday. Meanwhile, the ICI 'new' rose 4 to
636p and the existing shares added 8 at 1268p.
