FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Lockheed lifted by fighter
aircraft group
LOCKHEED, the US defence and aerospace group, reported a 21 per cent rise in
second-quarter earnings, helped by its aeronautical systems group and the
fighter aircraft company it acquired from General Dynamics in February.
It had net earnings of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.50 a share, compared to
Dollars 77m, or Dollars 1.24 in the same period of last year on sales which
rose 35 per cent to Dollars 3.35bn from Dollars 2.48bn.
Mr Dan Tellep, chairman, attributed the improvement to a strong aeronautical
systems group performance, while profits were p slightly for the missiles
and space group on lower sales.
Funded sign-ups of new and follow-on orders were p sharply due to Fort
Worth's F-16 programme backlog. Orders totalled Dollars 12bn for the first
half, compared to Dollars 4.3bn in the same period of 1992.
First-half net earnings were Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.72 a share, compared
to Dollars 143m, or Dollars 2.30, before the effect of accounting changes on
1992's figures.
