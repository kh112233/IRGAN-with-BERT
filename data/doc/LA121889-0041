5 KILLED, 7 MISSING IN EUROPEAN STORM 
A fierce storm lashed the English Channel and northern France for a second day 
Sunday, killing at least five people and leaving seven more missing, officials 
said. 
Among the five killed were a television journalist and another man -- both 
swept out to sea along the French coast. Winds in the storm exceeded 80 m.p.h. 
Six men were missing after their fishing vessel sank off the west coast of 
Scotland in the Firth of Clyde. An Irish sailor was listed as missing off 
southern Finistere after he fell into the sea.
