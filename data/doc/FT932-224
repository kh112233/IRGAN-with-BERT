FT  30 JUN 93 / Algerians mark Boudiaf slaying
MORE THAN 1,000 Algerians gathered yesterday at the tomb of Mr Mohammed
Boudiaf to commemorate the assassination of the former head of state a year
ago and protest at what they consider a whitewash in the official
explanation of his death.
At the government's behest, traffic across the country came to a respectful
halt during a moment of silence at 11.30am, the hour of his shooting in the
eastern town of Annaba.
However, crowds at the el-Alia cemetery turned the gathering into a
demonstration, waving banners calling on the government to tell 'the truth'
about the killing and chanting 'The assassins are in power'.
Postcards were distributed addressed to President Ali Kafi demanding a full
explanation of the assassination.
A commission of inquiry's verdict on the killing was that the assassination
was the act of one of his bodyguards, Mr Lembarek Boumarafi, who opened fire
on the 72-year-old leader while he was making a speech. Mr Boumarafi is
waiting trial.
Mr Boudiaf had returned to Algeria barely six months earlier from nearly 30
years of exile to lead his country, after the resignation of Mr Chadli
Bendjedid as president, and immediately gained popularity for his claims
that he would clean up corruption.
But yesterday's demonstration, and press comment this week, indicate that
few Algerians are satisfied. 'The explanations given have convinced no one,'
said an editorial yesterday in Liberte, the francophone daily.
The unease and suspicion have been heightened among Algeria's secular
intellectuals in recent months by a spate of other murders of prominent
scholars and writers in what appear to have been carefully planned
operations.
