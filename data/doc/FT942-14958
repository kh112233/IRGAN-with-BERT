FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Hint of light at the end of the
summer season  - Eurotunnel
Delays to the start of rail services through the Channel tunnel will mean
that Eurotunnel will have to rely on projections rather than hard figures
when it unveils its results on Thursday.
The numbers for 1993 will be largely academic but Sir Alastair Morton,
co-chairman of the Anglo-French venture, must have hoped to be able to
announce revenues from the first few months of operations.
Delays in signing off the tunnel, its signalling and communications systems
and the rolling stock, have prevented the start of commercial services,
however. A full freight and passenger service will not be running before
September-October, missing the crucial summer season.
These delays are costing Eurotunnel tens of millions of pounds a month in
lost fares and projected revenues of Pounds 224m for this year now look
hopelessly over-optimistic.
Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made towards resolving the
myriad of disputes which have bedevilled the project. The only outstanding
dispute is with the British and French railways but the ground has been
cleared for a rights issue of up to Pounds 750m, probably matched by a
similar amount of new bank loans, expected in May.
Eurotunnel's announcement that it plans to seek shareholder approval to
increase the number of shares available for this issue has raised fears that
it may be planning an even larger fund-raising or that it may be prepared to
offer shares at a deep discount.
Hanging over the rights issue will be the unresolved questions about the
tunnel's ability to attract the customers it needs to pay its way. Success
is dependent on continued expansion of the cross-Channel market and on
Eurotunnel making its published tariffs stick. Prospects for increased
traffic look good but avoiding a price war will be more difficult.
