FT  02 JUL 92 / Van Gogh sold for Pounds 1.32m: Saleroom
A VAN GOGH picture of a branch of almond blossom in a glass, executed at
Arles in 1888 and measuring only 19cm wide, was sold to a Japanese dealer
for Pounds 1.32m at Sotheby's on Tuesday.
The work may not be as bold, famous or expensive as Sunflowers, but its sale
double the estimate was a fillip to a market which is still struggling to
produce fresh, high-quality works of art.
This highly decorative study had not been seen on the market since 1909, or
exhibited since 1924.
There is no shortage of top-quality works on paper, however - or of
collectors keen to acquire them. Another success of the sale was a
pencil-and-gouache drawing by Egon Schiele of his wife Edith, sitting in a
black-and-white striped frock made from his atelier curtains. This
exceptionally large sheet of 1915 was secured for a record Pounds 572,000 by
Dr Rudolf Leopold,the notable Viennese collector, whose Schiele drawings
were shown at the Royal Academy last year.
The Schiele drawing of a girl in a blue dress and green stockings came from
the same source. It also soared over estimate to sell for Pounds 253,000.
The last year or so has seen record prices at auction for drawings by
Matisse, Gauguin, Millet and Daumier.
Monet's 'Les Alpes Vues du Cap d'Antibes', which again had been in private
hands for some years, sold on target for Pounds 715,000. Half the 61 lots on
offer failed to find buyers. The sale totalled Pounds 6,508,700 with 48 per
cent bought in.
