FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks electricity profits
PROFITEERING by privatised electricity companies cost each customer Pounds
60 last year, Labour said yesterday.
Urging a new regulatory framework, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary,
said pre-tax profits of the 17 companies in England, Scotland and Wales
totalled Pounds 3.1bn, a 43 per cent increase over the previous year's total
of Pounds 2.2bn.
'In 1987-88, the last year before the electricity industry accounts started
to be 'adjusted' in preparation for privatisation, the total profits of the
industry were Pounds 1.2bn,' Mr Dobson said.
'Compared with that year, the new total of Pounds 3.1bn represents an
increase of no less than 150 per cent. Over the same period inflation was
only 31 per cent.
'If electricity profits had risen at the same rate, last year's profits
would have totalled Pounds 1.6bn, a shortfall of Pounds 1.5bn on what
happened.
'These excess profits of Pounds 1.5bn are equal to Pounds 60 per electricity
customer just in the last year alone.'
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman and chief executive of Midlands Electricity,
received a near-22 per cent increase last year.
His salary went up from Pounds 181,790 to Pounds 221,399. The basic was
Pounds 182,750, to which was added a performance-related bonus of Pounds
31,981 and benefits in kind. The previous year included a one-off payment on
privatisation.
