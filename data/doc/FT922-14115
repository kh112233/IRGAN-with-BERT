FT  08 APR 92 / Chilean 'exported bomb parts for Iraq'
THE Bush Administration, after 18 months of intensive investigation by its
Customs Service, has brought a civil complaint against Mr Carlos Cardoen,
the Chilean arms manufacturer, accusing him of money-laundering and
illegally exporting US material used to make cluster bombs for Iraq.
Ms Carol Hallet, customs commissioner, said the US filed a legal action to
seize Dollars 33m of bank accounts and Florida properties owned by Mr
Cardoen because of the illegal exports.
Ms Hallet said Mr Cardoen was accused of illegally shipping from the US to
Chile about 100 tonnes of munitions-grade zirconium, a key metal used in
making cluster bombs. Teledyne Wah Chung, an Oregon company, was named as
the zirconium supplier in the suit. No charges have been filed against
Teledyne.
The US government suit states that Mr Cardoen - a mysterious figure who was
Saddam Hussein's biggest supplier of cluster bombs and factory technology -
laundered more than Dollars 200m of profits from cluster bomb sales through
Geneva and Miami. Some profits were used to buy Florida property.
Mr Cardoen has had an ambiguous relationship with the US and last year
denied having worked with the Central Intelligence Agency to clandestinely
channel military products to Iraq. At a Miami press conference, US officials
said they found no evidence of meetings between Mr Cardoen and Mr Robert
Gates, CIA director who himself denied reports of such meetings.
Ms Hallet described Mr Cardoen as 'one of the world's most notorious
merchants of death.' But a joint investigation by the Financial Times and
ABC News/Nightline last year uncovered an April 1987 cable from the US
embassy in Santiago to Washington in which Mr Cardoen was described as 'a
responsible recipient of US products.'
