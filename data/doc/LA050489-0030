CINCO DE MAYO; 
WIDE RANGE OF FESTIVITIES SCHEDULED FOR SOUTHLAND 
Cinco de Mayo will be observed throughout Southern California this weekend with 
celebrations featuring Mexican music, dance, traditional foods and discussions. 
Cinco de Mayo commemorates an important victory in Mexican history and is 
recalled with pride by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. 
 On May 5, 1862, a small Mexican force overwhelmed 7,500 French troops in the 
town of Puebla. Although the French went on to dominate Mexico for five years, 
the Mexicans' success grew to symbolize the people's struggle against foreign 
domination. 
 The following are some of the Cinco de Mayo events being held in various 
communities.
