JUDGE DROPS SUICIDE-DEVICE MURDER CASE 
A judge today threw out a murder charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the death 
of an Alzheimer's disease patient who used his so-called suicide machine to 
take her life. 
Kevorkian turned and shook hands with a defense attorney after Clarkston 
District Judge Gerald McNally dismissed a first-degree murder charge in the 
death of Janet Adkins. 
McNally said prosecutors failed to prove Kevorkian planned and carried out 
Adkins' death June 4, adding that she, not Kevorkian, caused the death. 
McNally, noting Michigan has no specific law against assisting suicide, said it 
is up to the Legislature to clarify state law. 
Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Michael Modelski said he would 
appeal. 
McNally's ruling came after a two-day preliminary hearing to determine whether 
Kevorkian, of suburban Royal Oak, should stand trial. An outspoken advocate of 
the concept of doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, Kevorkian has 
acknowledged hooking up Adkins to his machine, which put a lethal combination 
of drugs into her bloodstream after she pushed a button. 
The only alternatives available to the judge today were allowing the 
first-degree murder charge to go to trial or throwing it out. He could not 
substitute a lesser charge. 
On Wednesday, attorneys introduced a suicide note purportedly signed by Adkins, 
saying she freely chose to have Kevorkian help her commit suicide before she 
deteriorated further from Alzheimer's. 
"This is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is freely considered," 
the note read. "I have Alzheimer's disease and I don't want it to progress any 
further. I don't want to put myself or my family through any more of this 
terrible disease." 
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died shortly after noon June 4. Later that day, 
Kevorkian let police search his van and seize his device before offering a 
statement about his role in Adkins' death.
