FT  30 JUN 93 / Former Fiat cars chief investigated
MR Vittorio Ghidella, former managing director of Fiat's cars subsidiary,
has been issued with a cautionary warrant by magistrates in Bari
investigating alleged irregularities at a subsidiary of the Efim state
holding company, now in voluntary liquidation, writes Haig Simonian from
Milan.
The charges involve Oto Trasm, in which Graziano Trasmissioni, a company
chaired by Mr Ghidella, has a 49 per cent stake. Warrants have also been
issued against five other managers of Oto Trasm appointed by Graziano
Trasmissioni. The charges include embezzlement against the state and
fraudulent trading of the company's shares. Mr Ghidella, who set up in
business independently after leaving Fiat, is now involved in the Swiss
Saurer engineering group and Italian automotive activities.
