FT  30 JAN 92 / South Africa sees no early access to IMF
SOUTH AFRICA does not expect to gain access to loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) until after this year's US elections, according to the
deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank), Mr Jaap
Meijer.
Mr Meijer said he believed it would be politically impossible in an election
year to persuade the US Congress to repeal legislation blocking South
Africa's access to IMF funding, introduced as part of a US sanctions package
aimed at forcing political reform on Pretoria.
In Cape Town, Mr Meijer said IMF funding was not immediately necessary, as
the country was running a healthy surplus on the current account of the
balance of payments, estimated at R7bn (Pounds 1.4bn) for 1991. Gold and
foreign exchange reserves are also strong, reaching R10bn by the end of last
year.
However, economic growth had been disappointing in 1991, with real GDP
estimated to have contracted by about half a per cent.
Positive real growth is expected to resume this year, with the Reserve Bank
forecasting a 1.5 per cent increase.
