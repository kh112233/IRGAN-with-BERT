FT  12 OCT 93 / Cheap drugs attract the giants: Growth in generics is being
driven by the expiry of patents
Hoechst's Dollars 550m (Pounds 364m) acquisition last week of a majority
stake in Copley Pharmaceutical, a US generic drug manufacturer, surprised
the drugs industry only by its price. The deal is one of the largest in the
Dollars 5.5bn US generics drug sector which manufactures cheap medicines
whose patents have expired.
The Dollars 550m price tag values Copley at 87 times net profits of Dollars
12.3m last year, a high multiple by any standards. However, Mr Jurgen
Dormann, Hoechst's finance director, said the price was appropriate in view
of Copley's profitability - it has a net return on sales of at least 24 per
cent.
Hoechst's strategy of entering the US generic non-patented prescription
medicine business was, however, predictable. It is the latest in a series of
moves by pharmaceuticals groups to enter this fast-growing sector. Over the
past two years, the 1980s trend for companies to leave the low-margin
high-volume generics industry has been reversed.
The generics market is growing rapidly as increasingly important drugs lose
their patents, and cost-conscious healthcare providers become more
interested in cheap generic medicines. For the research-based
pharmaceuticals groups, marketing a generic version of their drugs can
extend its earnings stream.
Earlier this month Marion Merrell Dow acquired Rugby-Darby's generic
operations, the largest generic business in the US with sales of about
Dollars 280m. Other drugs groups which have recently joined the generics
industry include Merck, the world's largest drugs group, and Bristol-Myers,
the third largest.
Such companies have been tempted by the rapid expansion of the US generics
sector, which Hoechst expects to grow at 14 per cent a year for the rest of
the decade. Kline &amp; Co, the New York-based industry analysts, estimate that
the sector could double its size to Dollars 10bn a year between 1992 and
1996.
This compares favourably with the entire US prescription drugs market which
grew only 3 per cent in the first six months of this year, according to IMS
International, the market research group. The slowdown is expected to worsen
in the short-term.
The generics market is being driven by important patents expiring. Last year
seven drugs, with combined annual sales of about Dollars 2.5bn, came off
patent in the US. This year, the patents of 11 medicines with yearly sales
of Dollars 3bn expired. The most significant include Syntex's
anti-inflammatory Naprosyn, next month; Seldane, Marion Merrell Dow's
anti-histamine, in April; and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, in May.
The biggest will be Bristol-Myers Squibb's heart drug Capoten, which has
sales of about Dollars 1.6bn and becomes vulnerable to generic competition
in 1995.
The pharmaceuticals groups want to manufacture generic versions so they can
extend their products' earnings. Marion Merrell Dow produces a generic
version of its heart drug Cardizem, while Warner-Lambert makes a generic of
its cholesterol-lowering product Lopid. The explosion in generics sales is
also being encouraged by changes in the market, where bulk purchasers of
health are increasingly prescribing cheap generics rather than more pricy
patented medicines. In 1991, 40 per cent of all prescriptions in the US were
generic. The figure is expected to reach 66 per cent by 1995, according to
Kline &amp; Co. Hoechst believes the Clinton healthcare reforms willboost
demand.
The foremost problem facing drugs groups wanting to exploit the US generics
market is how to enter it. The options include acquisition, setting up from
scratch and partnerships.
Some groups have set up their own companies. These include Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, the Franco-American group, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb, of the
US, and the UK's Zeneca. Merck plans to introduce off-patent versions of 10
products through its West Point Pharma subsidiary.
Others have formed partnerships. Upjohn, for example, has formed an alliance
with Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home Products, to
market a generic form of Upjohn's hormone replacement therapy. Upjohn has
also signed an agreement with Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Ciba
of Switzerland, to market Xanax, an anti-anxiety treatment, and Halcion, the
sleeping pill, whose patents expired last month.
Companies such as Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham, which quit the sector, may
now be reviewing their strategy. A few companies, such as Ciba, never left
it.
Research-based pharmaceuticals groups must be quick to market their
products. Generics companies have proved increasingly aggressive in their
ability to market drugs from the day of their patent expiry. As more generic
versions become available so prices fall. Prices for generics of Zeneca's
best-selling product Tenormin fell 13 per cent on the first day of the
patent expiry, 25 per cent within two months, and by 80 per cent once there
were six competitors.
Given the sector's rapid growth, the rush into generics looks set to
continue. Shares in small groups soared following the Hoechst announcement.
Myland's stock rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 30 1/2 while
Pharmaceutical Resources was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 . Investors
clearly believe these are potential acquisition targets for the
pharmaceuticals giants wanting to follow Hoechst's example.
