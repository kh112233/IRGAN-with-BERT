FT  25 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Gas explosion ..
  .causes major damage, as many have no doubt already remarked. The prime
minister reacted to British Gas chairman Mr Robert Evans's 17.6 per cent
salary increase by saying that he expects senior executives to exercise
leadership in matters of pay.
This tight-lipped comment deserves an award for self-restraint, but it is
ambiguous: Mr Evans could claim that in a year of falling profits, this is
leadership. This claim would make as much sense as the routine defence
offered by British Gas - that it must pay enough to hold on to talent. The
bidding for 64-year-olds with a lifetime CV in a nationalised industry is
hardly hectic.
The rational explanations that suggest themselves are equally implausible -
for example, that Mr Evans wants a Labour victory, since it might remove the
Conservative threat to the BG monopoly; or that this is a subtle plot by Mr
Peter Walker, who sits on the BG remuneration committee, to re-enter the
Tory leadership race.
The only serious issue is not political: it is that contracts like his,
which are not subject to shareholder review or approval, are an anomaly in
any public company. Meanwhile, Mr Evans has placed an each-way bet: he wins
enough to pay his tax if Labour wins, or to sweeten political exile if it
loses.
