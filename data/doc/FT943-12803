FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price cuts second-term
loss
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, suffered another loss
in the second quarter, but scraped together its first operating profit in
almost a year.
The Toronto-based company reported a net loss of CDollars 17.7m (USDollars
12.6m), or 19 cents a share, down from CDollars 19.8m, or 29 cents, a year
earlier.
The latest figures include a CDollars 5.2m charge stemming from the expected
closure of a newsprint machine at Grand Falls, Newfoundland.
Interest expenses rose sharply. Operating profit from continuing operations
was CDollars 2.9m, against a CDollars 10.8m loss.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to CDollars 518.6m, mainly due to higher volumes.
Mr Ron Oberlander, chief executive, predicted higher prices and further
cost-cutting should produce better results in the second half.
Abitibi painted an encouraging picture of the newsprint market.
A 7 per cent cut in discounts was implemented earlier this year in North
America and another 6 per cent reduction has been announced for mid-August.
Newsprint consumption at US daily newspapers was 4.5 per cent higher in May
than a year earlier, while customer inventories have fallen by about a
quarter.
Offshore consumption has also grown, with Abitibi's shipments rising by
93,300 tonnes during the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
Newsprint and groundwood paper output climbed to 1.2m tonnes in the first
half, from 1.1m tonnes a year earlier. Second-quarter production was up 16
per cent.
