FT  16 JUN 92 / Germans defend treaty
THE chief economists of Germany's top three commercial banks yesterday sent
out a counterblast to the severe criticism of the Maastricht treaty on EC
economic and monetary union published by 60 professors this month.
'The arguments of the German professors on Maastricht breathe the spirit of
the 1970s', the economists said in a joint statement by Mr Norbert Walter of
Deutsche Bank, Mr Ernst Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank, and Mr Ulrich Ramm of
Commerzbank. 'They play down the risks of a regression to national narrow
mindedness in the 1990s.'
The professors, mostly younger academics but including the respected senior
figures of Mr Herbert Giersch, former head of the Kiel economics institute,
and Mr Karl Schiller, former economics and finance minister, had criticised
Emu's haste and questioned whether a European central bank would be
genuinely independent.
The bank economists said Emu was not just a 'desirable goal' of European
integration, as the professors put it, but the logical continuation of the
European Monetary System (EMS) and thus an enhancement of the development
towards a true European internal market.
Nor were the Maastricht criteria for economic convergence ahead of Emu too
weak, the economists said.
In fact, they were so strict even countries such as Belgium and Ireland with
ambitious financial goals could not achieve them at present.
