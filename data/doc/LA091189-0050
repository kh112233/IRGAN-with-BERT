Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic Ocean 
whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach-goers out to sea and capsizing boats from 
Maine to New York. At least six people were reported missing in accidents the 
Coast Guard said were related to the sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 
feet high, even on rivers. Waves from the storm swamped a 42-foot houseboat off 
New York City, washing its 11 occupants overboard, authorities said. One woman 
drowned and a 35-year-old man was reported missing. Gabrielle's wind had 
weakened to 75 m.p.h. and the storm was located 600 miles east of New Jersey 
and 335 miles south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Weather Service 
in Boston said.
