RESTAURANT CHAIN ACCUSED OF VIOLATING CHILD LABOR LAWS 
The federal Department of Labor has filed suit charging that the company that 
operates 23 Roy Rogers Restaurant franchises violated child labor laws, 
officials said today. 
The lawsuit charges that Stamford, Conn.-based Eastern Hospitality Inc. has 
violated provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standard Act since 1986 by 
employing 14- and 15-year-olds to work more than the hours permitted under 
federal law and has illegally hired workers, ages 14 through 17, to operate and 
clean power-driven meat-slicing machines. 
Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the plaintiff on behalf of the Labor 
Department, is seeking a court injunction to halt the alleged violations and to 
secure back overtime pay for 134 workers, court papers said.
