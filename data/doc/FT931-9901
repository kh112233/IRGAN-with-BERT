FT  11 FEB 93 / Church launches corporate video
THE CHURCH of England, which has a Pounds 500m annual budget and 11,000
clergy, is bringing itself into line with other organisations of its size by
releasing a corporate video.
'Yours faithfully, the Church of England' was launched yesterday to depict
in 28 minutes some of the range and variety of the Church's activities.
It shows Dr George Carey's enthronement as archbishop of Canterbury; the
work of industrial chaplains on Tyneside; Dr John Habgood, archbishop of
York, speaking on the asylum bill in the House of Lords, and November's
general synod vote in favour of women priests.
The Rev Eric Shegog, the Church's director of communications, said the
Christian church had always employed the latest forms of communication as
they evolved. 'We started with illustrated manuscripts, went into
stained-glass windows and when Caxton came along we jumped on that
bandwagon.'
Although initially available only on subscription, the Pounds 10 video will
eventually be for retail sale. It was made by Boxclever Productions, whose
other clients include British Aerospace, at a cost of Pounds 30,000.
In true corporate tradition, the video ends with a message from the
archbishop of Canterbury suggesting the customer might care to sample the
product. Dr Carey says: 'Whatever a person is looking for, you are bound to
find it in the Church of England.'
