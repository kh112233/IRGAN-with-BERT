FT  02 DEC 93 / Falkland Island oil hopes
Britain's Foreign Office yesterday played down the significance of a survey
suggesting a good chance of finding oil in the South Atlantic around the
Falkland Islands.
Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a
seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential
is good all around the islands. But we will not know exactly how much oil is
there until someone starts digging.'
The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most
likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the
North Sea, the survey said.
But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary,
since full seismic data would only become available next year. It further
emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence
of oil.
A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned. Only
after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed.
Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial
quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around
the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said this year that co-operation on
oil exploration with Argentina remained a possibility. Oil company
executives have said large-scale investment of oil development in the region
would require a more explicit agreement on sovereignty than exists at
present.
