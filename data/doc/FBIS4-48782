  [Text] Nairobi, 25 May (AFP) -- The United Nations has 
sponsored a new round of peace talks in southern Somalia, but 
many Somali faction leaders failed to turn up, a UN spokesman 
said Wednesday [25 May]. Leaders of a southern faction allied 
to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid were absent from the opening of 
the talks in the port city of Kismaayo on Tuesday, attended by 
the leader of a rival group, Mohamed Said Hersi, known as 
"General Morgan," son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. 
Aidid's chief financier Osman Ato was there, but Somali 
analysts said it was unclear whether Ato was still a close 
advisor to the warlord. 
  Kismaayo, 500 kilometres (300 miles) south-west of the 
capital Mogadishu, has been repeatedly battered by fighting 
between two rival factions of the Somali Patriotic Movement 
[SPM], one led by Morgan and the other, allied with Aidid, by 
Omar Jays. 
  Neither Jays nor other key figures from the rival SPM group 
such as Aden Abdullahi Noor Gabyo turned up. They were said to 
be "resolving differences between themselves" and might come to 
the Lower Juba regional peace conference which is to last at 
least a week in a few days, said spokesman George Bennett. 
  Previous UN efforts to broker a peace accord among Somalia's 
15 warring factions have failed to end anarchy in the 
war-ravaged Horn of Africa nation. Peace talks including all 
main faction leaders are scheduled to open in Nairobi at the end 
of this month.
