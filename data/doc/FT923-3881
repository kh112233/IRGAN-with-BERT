FT  10 SEP 92 / Hanoi and Beijing give assurances on Spratly islands
THE foreign ministers of Vietnam and China gave assurances yesterday that
their dispute over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea would not
escalate into armed conflict, Reuter reports.
Nguyen Manh Cam, Vietnamese foreign minister, said in New Delhi that Vietnam
had repeated its demand that China stop prospecting for oil in what it
called Vietnamese territorial waters. The area for which China has signed a
drilling contract with a US company was on the continental shelf of Vietnam,
and Hanoi has asked China to cancel the contract, Mr Cam said.
But he added: 'We decided at our summit meeting that relations would not
come back to the period of the past 10 years.' Vietnam and China fought a
border war in 1979 and their navies clashed briefly over the Spratly Islands
in 1988.
In Bangkok, Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said the dispute would
not affect normalisation of ties between the two communist neighbours. 'In
our view, once the issue comes to peaceful negotiations, it is not difficult
to reach agreement, or at least it will not lead to confrontation,' Qian
said.
Cam said Vietnam had proposed that the dispute be resolved through a
regional effort by the six countries which have a total or partial claim on
the Spratlys - China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.
China's industrial production jumped 19 per cent in the first eight months
of 1992 compared with the same period last year, the Xinhua news agency
reported yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The State Statistical Bureau said that heavy industry output climbed 21.3
per cent from January to August and light industry 16.3 per cent to push
total industrial production to 1,792bn yuan (Pounds 165bn).
