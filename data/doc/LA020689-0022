Carbon monoxide fumes from propane heaters built up in an ice-fishing shanty on 
a frozen lake near Manitowoc, Wis., and killed four teen-agers -- three boys 
and a girl -- sheriff's officers said. The 7-foot-by-6 1/2-foot wooden shanty 
was one of more than 50 such shelters on Harpt Lake. The victims were staying 
overnight as they participated in an ice-fishing derby. A friend of the victims 
who was going to join them fishing found the bodies at dawn. "The girl's father 
was in the shack right next door. He tried mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation, said 
Mary Lee Stueck, a contest organizer.
