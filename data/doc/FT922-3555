FT  11 JUN 92 / German economists assail Emu
MORE THAN 60 professors of monetary economics and international finance,
from schools and universities across Germany, will today publish a
declaration condemning the Maastricht treaty on European economic and
monetary union.
Their intervention at a time of growing doubts about the Maastricht treaty
may be a serious embarrassment to the German government as it tries to gain
swift ratification in the two houses of parliament.
The document does not question the principle of Emu and a single European
currency, but criticises its haste, the decision to make such a move
automatic by 1999 at the latest, and the laxity of the convergence criteria
on which it is based.
They also question how genuine the independence will be of the future
European central bank.
Among signatories are such leading figures as Professor Herbert Giersch,
former head of the Kiel Institute, Professor Karl Schiller, former economics
and finance minister, and Professor Klaus Roser, author of the main German
textbook on international finance.
