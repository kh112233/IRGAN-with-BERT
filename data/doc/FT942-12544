FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: Caracas set for airline auction
Nine Venezuelan and international groups have been given the green light to
tender for Aeropostal, a government-owned airline to be auctioned off next
month.
Aeropostal, with domestic and international routes, is the first asset
offered for sale under an ambitious privatisation programme by the
three-month-old administration of President Rafael Caldera.
The Venezuelan Investment Fund, a financial agency in charge of
privatisation, said the groups prequalified for bidding on Aeropostal were:
British Aerospace/Avro International Aerospace; Air France; Iberia; American
Airlines; Continental Airlines; Aerolineas Centrales de Colombia; and three
consortia led by Venezuelan financial institutions (Banco Progreso, Banco
Itlao Venezolano/S F Profesional and Banco Union). Minimum price for the
airline would be Dollars 62m (Pounds 41.1m).
The Caldera administration has said 'accelerated' privatisation is an
important part of its economic recovery plan. But privatisation has been
delayed since March, when the first sale was originally set.
The previous government got more than Dollars 2bn from privatisations and
was set to auction Aeropostal and other assets. But political instability
that began with a failed coup in 1992 limited progress.
The Caldera government also plans to auction three electric power companies,
several hotels and horseracing tracks.
