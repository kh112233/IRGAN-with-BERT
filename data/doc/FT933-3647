FT  13 SEP 93 / Benefits of rivalry in utilities 'unclear'
UTILITY regulators should pay more attention to consumer interests before
trying to introduce greater competition into household utility services,
because the benefits are far from clear, the National Consumer Council
warns.
The council says in a report issued today that the results of the
privatisation of the gas, water, electricity and telephone industries have
been very mixed and the consumer's interests have not always been served as
well as those of the business user or the shareholder.
The publicly funded council's report says that water charges have risen far
above the rate of inflation because companies have been allowed to pass on
modernisation costs. Electricity prices have risen slightly less than
inflation, but only because companies were obliged to hand back earlier
increases.
Telephone charges appear to have risen faster for small consumers than for
businesses and, while gas prices have fallen, charges for industrial
consumers are much lower than those for households.
The report says that regulation of all these sectors can be improved. But
the answer to high or uneven pricing is not necessarily more competition.
It says: 'The regulators should carry out proper cost/benefit analyses of
the effects of introducing competition into these services. These analyses
must include the implications for domestic consumers.'
