FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Robotics chief warns of tough
12-months
EUROPE'S Dollars 500m robotics market is facing a tough year in 1993 because
of the recession in Germany and reduced investment by the automotive sector,
said Mr Bruce Potts, executive vice-president of Fanuc Robotics Europe.
But the market was likely to bounce back next year because of strong
underlying demand for robots by European manufacturers keen to improve their
productivity, he said.
Mr Potts was speaking in Coventry at the unveiling by Fanuc Robotics, the
world's largest robot producer, of its new series of robot control systems.
The controller is a key plank in Fanuc's strategy to broaden the use of
robots in non-automotive markets; in Europe, for example, about 60 per cent
of the installed base of 50,000 to 60,000 robots is used by the motor
industry.
It is also an important element in Fanuc's strategy to become the market
leader in Europe, where, said Mr Potts, it runs a 'solid second' behind ABB
Robotics.
In the past two years, the European robotics market has been relatively more
resilient than other sectors of mechanical engineering.
Last year, the market was flat, with weakness in some countries offset by
the effects of reunification in Germany, which accounts for about half the
total market, and by carmakers' spending.
This year, said Mr Potts, the North American robot market will come out of
recession and will be the best-performing of the major markets. The European
market could fall from last year, but would still perform better than the
recession-bound Japanese market.
Fanuc believes the new controller will have the same effect on the robot
market as the 'graphical user interface' had on personal computers by making
the robot easier to understand for users in areas such as welding,
mechanical handling and painting.
