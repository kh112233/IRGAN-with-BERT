AUDI, a division of Germany's Volkswagen group, said negotiations to build

Audi Hungaria Motor, had been founded, Reuter reports from Munich.
An agreement between Audi and Hungary's ministry for industry and trade, the
finance ministry and the ministry for international relations has been

The plant will be established at Gyoer, between Bratislava and Budapest,
where Audi plans initially to build about 1,000 engine components daily
