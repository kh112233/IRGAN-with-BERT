FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kode selling computer lossmaker for Pounds
1.5m
Kode International, which fell into the red in the first half of this year,
yesterday announ-ced the sale of its lossmaking computer services division,
DCM, for an expected Pounds 1.5m.
Mr Stephen Day, chief executive, said conditions in the computer maintenance
market had been very difficult for more than a year. DCM made interim losses
of Pounds 881,000 this year after being hit by a sudden fall in prices in
the third party maintenance market in the latter part of 1993.
In August, Kode saw its market value halved after it fell into pre-tax
losses of Pounds 515,000 (Pounds 710,000 profits) - there was also an
exceptional charge of Pounds 350,000 against its computer services side.
The shares hit a low of 38p, but yesterday continued their recovery with a
9p rise to 71p.
Mr Day said that the DCM sale would enable Kode to concentrate resources on
the development of its profitable printed circuit board businesses 'where
trading continues to be strong'.
DCM is being sold to Tellus Holdings. Kode will receive Pounds 1.5m, of
which Pounds 900,000 is payable in 13 monthly instalments, subject to a
reduction of up to Pounds 250,000 following a review of completion accounts.
The proceeds will be used to reduce bank borrowings.
Kode plans a capital reorganisation to replenish holding company reserves
following the sale.
