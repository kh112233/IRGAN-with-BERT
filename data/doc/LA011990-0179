P. M. BRIEFING; 
JOB-DEATH VERDICT OVERTURNED 
A state appellate court today overturned the murder convictions of three former 
executives in the work-related death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the 
job. 
The 1985 Cook County Circuit Court verdict against executives of Elk Grove 
Village-based Film Recovery Systems Inc. was believed to be the first in which 
corporate officials were convicted of murder charges in a job-related death. 
The appellate court ruled that the convictions on charges of murder, 
involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct were "irreconcilable" because of 
the different mental states required for such findings, said defense attorney 
Elliot Samuels. 
"The court has opened the door for a new prosecution," Samuels said. 
Stefan Golab, 61, a Polish immigrant who worked at the plant where cyanide was 
used to recover silver from used X-ray film, collapsed at work after 
complaining of dizziness and nausea in 1983. His death was attributed to 
cyanide poisoning from inhaling fumes on the job.
