  [Text] Amman, May 29 (AFP) -- UN disarmament chief Rolf 
Ekeus said Sunday he had made headway in talks here with Iraqi 
officials on applying UN resolutions to destroy Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  "We have made certain progress. But we have to preserve it 
to maintain the momentum," Ekeus told AFP after meeting Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf late Saturday, who was 
on a stopover en route for Cairo. 
  The head of the UN Special Commission for Iraqi disarmament 
(UNSCOM) is to present a report to the UN Security Council on 
Tuesday on setting up a long-term monitoring of Iraqi military 
capability due to start in July, a reliable source said. 
  Ekeus was due to resume talks late Sunday with an Iraqi 
delegation including General 'Amir Rashid head of the Iraqi 
military industries. 
  He expressed his "satisfaction" over the initial talks with 
Iraqi officials, saying they aimed at "clarifying certain issues 
in order to make progress." 
  "We are fairly satisfied, although we have not concluded our 
talks yet," he said noting that any eventual lifting of the 
Iraqi sanctions would be decided by the Security Council. 
  A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in 
August 1990, before Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army was 
driven out again by a U.S.-led coalition in February 1991. 
  But the embargo has remained in force backed by UN 
resolutions requiring Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass 
destruction and set up a long-term monitoring system. 
  Ekeus said the aim was to get the embargo lifted, adding 
that 
"we are trying to establish whether (Iraq) has respected the UN 
resolutions." 
  Iraq has argued on several occasions that it has complied 
fully with the resolutions. 
  He is in Amman for a meeting of the UN Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia, which opened Sunday.
