FT  20 JUN 92 / World Bank admits Indian dam flawed
THE World Bank is to make substantial modifications in plans for one of the
world's biggest dam projects, after accepting criticism of the project in an
independent report as justified.
Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, said the report on the
controversial Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) Narmada dam system in central India
had identified a 'number of deficiencies in the bank's appraisal of the
project, the borrower's implementation and the bank's supervision work'.
The independent inquiry, the first of its kind in the World Bank's history,
was set up after vociferous protests in India over the resettlement and
environmental aspects of the project.
In a rare and candid admission that the Bank had been wrong, Mr Preston
said: 'It is clear that performance under these projects has fallen short of
what is called for under Bank policies and guidelines and the policies of
the government of India.'
He said continued bank support for Narmada was justified but 'we should
proceed only if practical ways can be agreed to ensure that the pace of
further construction of the dam is adjusted to whatever extent is required
to permit a fully responsible approach to the resettlement and environmental
concerns'.
Mr Preston said analysis of the report and 'a set of specific remedial
actions' would be presented to the World Bank's board in the next few days.
The bank has promised to put Dollars 450m into the irrigation scheme along
the Narmada river, which flows through the north-eastern states of Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
Opponents of the project say such huge dams are environmentally unsound and
accuse the state governments of resettling people, many of them tribal
people not integrated into India, on inferior land with inadequate
compensation.
The government says about 100,000 people will be displaced in the project.
Opponents put the figure at 250,000.
