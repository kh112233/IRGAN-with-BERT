FT  16 JUN 94 / Foreign investment up in Algeria
For the first time since Algeria became independent in 1962, foreign
companies last year drilled more total depth than the state oil and gas
company, Sonatrach, writes Francis Ghiles.
Sonatrach said that foreign investment by the 18 international oil companies
which have so far signed exploration contracts with it grew by a third to
Dollars 199m (Pounds 132.6m) and was forecast to rise to Dollars 236m in
1994.
