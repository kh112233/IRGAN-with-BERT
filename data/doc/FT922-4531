FT  05 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Plastics believe in
reincarnation
Plastics are a prime source of environmental pollution and the volume of
waste and scrapped plastics is increasing every year. Now Mazda Motor, the
Japanese car manufacturer, has announced two new developments which should
help efforts to recycle and re-use the material.
One is a new decomposing catalyst capable of recovering oils from all types
of plastics including chlorinated ones which have previously been difficult
to decompose.
The other is said to be the world's first plastic composite which can be
reused more than five times. The new material combines a liquid crystal
polymer for reinforcement with easy-to-use thermoplastic. It can be used as
a structural material, for example in car frames. Mazda: Japan, 82 285 1030.
