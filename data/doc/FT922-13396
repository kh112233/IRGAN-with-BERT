FT  11 APR 92 / Arts: Trio too cute in tinsel
IS THERE life after Bananarama? Well, yes and no; more a kind of purgatory,
with a deep dread that things might get worse. Siobhan Fahey was responsible
for a third of the outrages of Bananarama, the manufactured all-girl trio
which gave the public what they wanted to hear and the critics what they
wanted to tear apart.
Fed up with stealing sweets from children, she teamed up with Marcella
Detroit, a substantial songwriter in every sense, to form Shakespear's
Sister. The jokey name (note the dropping of the final 'e') says it all, as
did the empty stage at the Town and Country - empty apart from multi-tonnes
of hardware, which confronted the packed audience for many tedious minutes
before the girls leapt on to it, wearing the kind of tinselly jump suits
that you thought had disappeared with Sweet.
There is nothing much wrong with Shakespear's Sister - dammit, they have a
heavy selling single in 'Stay' - which a little objectivity would not cure.
They are just too consciously cute, Fahey larking about the stage like an
ingenue auditioning for 'That's Life.' But their management has been able to
afford a very professional back-up band - not least the guitarist, a louche
youth who looks incredulous when Fahey lies down, hammering her heels into
the stage, over-excited by his performance.
So it is just a show, with the music a bit Poppy, a bit punky, a bit
pretentious. The unique selling proposition is the strong voices of the duo,
plus their white-faced girls-on-top look. It is all rather reminiscent of
1970s Poly rock. The best songs were the more soulful, like 'Heaven is in
Your Heartbeat,' which seems at odds with the relentless clowning.
Superficially, Shakespear's Sister are fine, but there is enough talent on
offer to produce an enduring class act. Perhaps success has come too easy,
too soon.
