FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Knock knock
Guess who's moving in next door to Lord Rothschild, Rupert Murdoch and John
Paul Getty 11 in a particularly salubrious corner of St James's, just off
London's Green Park? Popping round for a cup of sugar any moment now will be
Tiny Rowland's bete noire, Dieter Bock, the German financier, who last week
rechristened his Lonrho colleague as his 'dear disjointed chief executive'.
The building containing Bock's new flat was designed in 1960 by the high
priest of British modernism, Sir Denys Lasdun. Being something of a design
freak himself, Bock is in the process of gutting the apartment to return it
to its former glory.
While Observer is not party to the price at which Bock secured his new pad,
the asking price, for a 32-year-lease, was Pounds 1.8m, with service charges
in excess of an annual Pounds 25,000.
Apparently the basement car parking space costs another Pounds 5,500 a year
 -which seems a bit steep for someone whose favourite modes of transport are
supposed to be a 2CV and a bike.
