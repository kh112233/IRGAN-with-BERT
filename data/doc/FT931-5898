FT  04 MAR 93 / Swiss MPs reject woman as minister
IT WAS no big surprise yesterday when a majority of (male) Swiss
parliamentarians voted down the nomination of Mrs Christiane Brunner to join
the country's seven-person Federal Council (cabinet).
Women have made little headway in Switzerland's senior government and
business circles.
The new cabinet minister this time had to be, like the outgoing foreign
minister, Mr Rene Felber, a Social Democratic party MP from the
French-speaking part of Switzerland. Mrs Brunner, 46, and a trade union
leader, was one of only two MPs to fit this profile and agreed to be a
candidate. She would have been only the second woman minister in Swiss
history.
In spite of being an MP for only 15 months, she won her party's endorsement,
partly because she was a woman and partly because she came from Geneva, a
canton which has not been represented in the cabinet for more than 70 years.
(Geneva was ready to declare a school holiday if she had won.)
But her casual manner and taste in clothes raised eyebrows in the
male-dominated political establishment, as did the fact that she has had
three husbands. After her rejection, women's groups gathered in front of
parliament, threw paint bombs and vowed to continue the tough battle for
equality. Mrs Brunner herself was in no doubt about the meaning of the vote.
'I am disappointed not for myself, but for all women in Switzerland.'
