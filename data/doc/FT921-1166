FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Skilled workers bolster Labour
A LARGE shift to Labour by the skilled working classes has been the driving
force behind the rebound in its support since 1987, an opinion poll
suggested last night.
The Harris poll for ITN gave Labour a four-point overall lead, with its
support at 42 per cent, the Conservatives at 38 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats at 16 per cent. That represents a swing of 7.5 per cent since the
last general election.
But the survey found that among the skilled working classes - the so-called
C2s - the swing had been 10 per cent since 1987. Conservative support had
fallen from 42 to 33 per cent, while Labour's share had jumped from 35 to 47
per cent, the survey indicated.
The group, now the central target of the Conservatives' onslaught against
Labour's tax and spending plans, accounted for about 25 per cent of all
voters and is likely to be the most important 'swing' group on April 9.
But the Harris survey shows that the main preoccupations of the C2s are the
quality of public services such as health and education and rising
unemployment, rather than personal tax bills. This suggests that the careful
pitch of Mr John Smith's Budget in offering small gains to the group has
helped neutralise the Conservative attack.
But there was encouragement in the poll for those Conservative strategists
who argue that the election is far from decided. It indicated that at least
4m voters have yet to make up their minds on which way to vote.
The Conservatives have secured a 4 per cent increase in their support in
Scotland, according to an ICM/Scotsman poll.
The figures (with findings for a March 7 poll in brackets) were:
Conservatives 22 per cent (18 per cent), Labour 41 per cent (42 per cent),
SNP 27 per cent (28 per cent), Liberal Democrats 9 per cent (11 per cent),
Others 2 per cent (1 per cent).
ICM interviewed 1,052 adults in 52 constituencies throughout Scotland on
Sunday and Monday.
