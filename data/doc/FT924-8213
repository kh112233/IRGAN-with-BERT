FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cabra calls in liquidators
PROVISIONAL liquidators have been appointed to Cabra Estates, the property
company that owns two London football grounds.
The move does not immediately affect its subsidiaries, including those which
own the grounds used by Chelsea and Fulham football clubs.
The appointment of the liquidators follows a request made to the court by
the company's directors. This resulted from its banks' demand for the
repayment of their loan on Monday, a move that triggered the suspension of
Cabra's shares on Tuesday.
