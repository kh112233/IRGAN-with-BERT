P.M. BRIEFING; 
JAPAN PLANS DRUG MONEY RULES 
The Japanese Finance Ministry is to issue guidelines to help local financial 
institutions stop attempts to launder illegal drug profits, ministry officials 
said today. 
The guidelines, which will take effect Oct. 1, will require banks and 
securities houses to be sure of the identity of depositors when they take new 
accounts or make cash transactions above a set amount, the officials said. 
"This will be the first step in our fight against drug-money laundering," one 
official said of the move to curtail the conversion of illegally obtained funds 
into financial assets that appear legitimate. 
The ministry officials said Japan will report the guidelines to a seven-nation 
economic summit meeting in Houston on July 9-11, where drug money may be a 
major topic.
