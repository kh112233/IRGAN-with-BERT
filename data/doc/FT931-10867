FT  05 FEB 93 / World News in Brief: Hillsborough victim allowed to die
Hillsborough victim Tony Bland, aged 21, is likely to die from infection
within two weeks, his doctors said after the House of Lords ruled that his
artificial feeding can be stopped. He has been in a persistent vegetative
state in Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire, since he was crushed at
the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989.
