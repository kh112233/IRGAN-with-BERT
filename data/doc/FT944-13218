FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK tourism
An industry where revenues grew by almost 13 per cent a year between 1985
and 1992 would appear to be in good health. But the British Tourist
Authority is not satisfied. It points out that, while the UK is still sixth
in the destination league, its share of world tourism has been declining
steadily. Rather than accepting this as inevitable - since less developed
destinations are likely to grow faster - the authority believes the loss of
market share can be tackled with a little more public money.
Given the jobs created by tourism, it might well be desirable if Britain
could keep pace with world market growth. It is less clear that it is
physically possible. At present levels of spending per head, such growth
would mean visitor numbers rising more than 50 per cent by 2001. However
successful the efforts to tempt visitors to travel out of season to less
congested areas, there must be some doubt whether the system will be able to
cope. The answer may be to concentrate less on numbers and more on
increasing spending per head. For companies such as Forte or British
Airways, it is quality rather than quantity that counts. The priority for
the industry as a whole should be to improve the quality and range of
facilities it offers. Due to the impact of the recession on room rates,
British hotels are less uncompetitive than they were. But they still suffer
from relatively high costs. For many, the best strategy may be to move
further upmarket.
