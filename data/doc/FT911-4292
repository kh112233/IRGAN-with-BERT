FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser earnings plunge by
60% in opening quarter
WEYERHAEUSER has joined the lengthening list of North American forest
products companies whose first-quarter profits have been battered by weak
pulp and paper markets.
The Seattle-based company suffered a 60 per cent plunge in net earnings to
Dollars 52.4m or 26 cents a share from Dollars 130.1m or 61 cents in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
Sales dipped by 10 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn.
Mr John Creighton, president, told the annual meeting yesterday that
recovery in the forest products industry is likely to lag the overall
economy as a result of massive over-supply.
He predicted that the pulp and paper industry's capacity utilisation rate
will drop to just above 80 per cent later this year from the present level
of the low 90s.
Mr Creighton said that export markets, which make up more than a fifth of
total revenues, are much stronger than North American demand.
Weyerhaeuser's newsprint, fine paper, personal care products and bleached
paperboard businesses all turned in a better performance last quarter than
in 1990.
But earnings for market pulp and paperboard were lower.
Mr Creighton also warned that capacity due to come on line during the course
of this year is depressing prices for several pulp and paper product lines.
