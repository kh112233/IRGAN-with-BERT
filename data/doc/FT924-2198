FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pfizer to increase R&amp;D
PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US drugs groups, is to increase its
annual research and development spending to more than Dollars 1bn next year.
Mr Henry McKinnel, chief financial officer, said the aim was to increase the
percentage of group sales from pharmaceuticals. During the first nine months
of this year drugs generated 62 per cent of its Dollars 5.28bn sales
compared with 54 per cent last year.
Mr McKinnel said the group would limit price rises on US prescription drugs
to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the coming year. The announcement
follows growing political pressure from Congress to limit price increases. A
number of other groups, including Merck, the largest US drugs company, have
undertaken not to raise prices or at least limit them to the rate of
inflation.
The promise to increase investment in research and development by up to 20
per cent next year follows an 18 per cent rise to Dollars 756.8m in 1991.
The investment is designed to help the group counter the expiry of patents.
