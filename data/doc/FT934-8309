FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Profits improve at US toy
retailer
PRE-TAX earnings at Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer, advanced 17 per cent
in the three months to the end of October. The result reflected the
continued benefits of increased sales of higher-margin products.
Although the results were close to analysts' expectations, the company's
share price, which had risen in recent weeks to a 12-month high, dipped
Dollars 1 1/2 on the news, to Dollars 41 3/8 .
Pre-tax earnings rose to Dollars 67.6m, as sales grew by 8 per cent during
the quarter from a year ago, to Dollars 1.45bn.
After a one-off charge of Dollars 5m due to the change in the US corporate
tax rate, net earnings were Dollars 37.5m, or 13 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 36.8m, or 12 cents, the year before.
US store sales saw a 'slight' increase year-on-year, said Mr Charles
Lazarus, chairman. German sales fell as the economy there slowed, though
other European and Canadian stores saw a sales increase.
The company plans to open between 100 and 115 stores next year, he said.
