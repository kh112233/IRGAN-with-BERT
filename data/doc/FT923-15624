FT  01 JUL 92 / Miyazawa to discuss trade rows
JAPANESE Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in the US yesterday on a
three-day visit ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Munich next week,
agencies report from Washington.
He will meet President George Bush at the White House today before flying by
helicopter to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, for more
talks. It will be the first meeting between the two leaders since Mr Bush's
trip to Tokyo in January, when his trade mission was overshadowed by his
collapse at a state dinner.
As well as a series of trade disputes between the US and Japan, they will
discuss aid to the ex-Soviet republics, nuclear safety, third world debt and
the Uruguay Round trade negotiations - all items high on the G7 agenda.
An official said the US side would press Japan to move more quickly to open
markets in such areas as semiconductors, glass and car parts.
He said Japan could expect US support for efforts to regain several small
islands occupied by the Soviet Union after the Second World War - a likely
issue when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visits Tokyo in September.
