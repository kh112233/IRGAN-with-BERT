FT  31 JAN 94 / Labour seeks Ofgas reversal
The Labour party is to ask the government to reverse a decision made last
week by Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, to relax the tariff formula by
which British Gas sets prices to 18m mainly residential customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer spokesman, said the tariff relaxation
and the imposition of valued added tax on fuel bills from April would cause
hardship among low-income householders. Ofgas says the change means an
average annual increase of only Pounds 2 per customer.
