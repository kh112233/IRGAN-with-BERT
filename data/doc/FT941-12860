FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: China-Russia pact to ease two-way trade
China and Russia yesterday signed an agreement covering 21 border crossings
to facilitate booming two-way trade worth nearly Dollars 8bn last year.
Both countries are anxious to strengthen regulations covering trade and
other exchanges along their common boundary where criminal activities are a
serious problem.
The agreement to improve cross-border co-operation was signed by Mr Qian
Qichen, China's foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his visiting
Russian counterpart.
The two men also discussed a forthcoming visit to Moscow by President Jiang
Zemin, security issues, and ways in which Russia might assist Chinese
economic development.
Mr Kozyrev said Russian contractors were anxious to participate in the
Dollars 20bn Three Gorges project on the Yangtze - the world's largest
hydro-electric engineering scheme. He also sought to assure the Chinese that
threats of political unrest at home would not be allowed to affect
relations.
'Further development of Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's
foreign policy and would not be affected by domestic political change in
Russia,' he was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency.
Sino-Russian two-way trade increased by about 30 per cent last year compared
with the year before. Eighty per cent of business is now channelled through
border crossings along a remote frontier.
Mr Kozyrev was accompanied by senior defence officials who have been
discussing with the Chinese ways in which technical co-operation might be
expanded.
