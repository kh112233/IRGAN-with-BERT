FT  28 APR 94 / MPs set to end feud on procedure
MPs are to resume talks on how to organise their working day more
rationally, under a deal put together to end Labour's four-month-long
procedural war against the government.
Under a package of measures unveiled at Westminster last night, fresh
attempts will also be made to agree more humane arrangements for enabling
critically-ill MPs to vote, and the possibility of raising Labour's quota of
committee chairmanships is to be discussed.
The deal clears the way for normal parliamentary relations to resume. Under
the protest, even non-contentious legislation was opposed and the practice
of 'pairing' - allowing MPs to miss a vote by being linked to a member in an
opposing party who agrees to be absent as well - was discontinued.
Labour claimed victory last night, saying the government had accepted it was
wrong on the issue which triggered the dispute: its decision to curtail
debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National
Insurance contributions.
But government business managers argued that they had 'given nothing away'.
Meanwhile, Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, condemned the
move as a 'sad and sorry capitulation' and said Labour had 'thrown in the
towel'.
Under last night's agreement, MPs will resume discussion of a report, tabled
two years ago by an all-party committee of MPs, which proposed a number of
changes to Westminster arrangements designed to reduce the number of
late-night sittings.
Some Conservatives have since accused Labour of 'going cold' on the report.
Labour was at pains to emphasise last night that the talks would include
discussion of its call for MPs to be given two weeks' notice of what
business is to be debated in the Commons.
