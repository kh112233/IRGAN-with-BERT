FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Time to take a
chance on Fisons - The portfolio is up 50 per cent in its first year. . .
Now for the high-risk purchase contemplated in past issues of the Review
WOULD THE second world war have happened in a different way and with
different consequences if an 18-year-old Winston Churchill had not fallen
out of a tree?
In 1893, Churchill was playing with some friends in Branksome Dene Chine, in
Poole. There was a wooden bridge, at treetop height, across the chine.
Churchill decided to jump from the bridge to the top of a tree, and then
climb down the tree to the bottom of the chine. Instead, he slipped and fell
almost 30 feet, knocking himself unconscious, rupturing a kidney and
breaking a shoulder.
While he was convalescing he spent a lot of time at the House of Commons,
became fascinated with political life, and resolved to become an MP. If he
had not fallen out of a tree, would he have entered politics and become
prime minister?
What do incidents like this have to do with a portfolio of investments? They
help to show why economists are so often wrong. You cannot predict the
unpredictable.
Economic models can point to possibilities - but it is people who make
things happen. Even a few, determined people, can bring about dramatic
changes, either within a country or within a company. An understanding of
people's behaviour and an absorption of 'sentiment' can often be a better
predictor of events (including share prices) than economic models. But even
this can be overturned by unexpected events. The period between now and the
new year seems to be full of unpredictables, and this has a bearing on
investment strategy.
The British government has problems with the EC. The British economy shows
few signs of revival. In Germany there are enormous problems with racial
unrest and the unfulfilled expectations of the east Germans.
In the countries that used to be the USSR, there are so many problems that
it will take strong and determined action to resolve them.
In circumstances like these, what do I do with this portfolio? It is one
year since, with some trepidation, I started with a notional Pounds 10,000
to 'invest'. That has now grown to Pounds 15,328 - a rise of more than 50
per cent in 12 months. The portfolio was considerably helped by the takeover
of its investment in Taveners by Toms Fabrikker, a Danish chocolate and
confectioner manufacturer. This turned an investment of Pounds 2,450 into
cash of Pounds 5,985.
Its investment in Pentland Group, where the shares have outperformed the
market, also helped the portfolio, which received a dividend from that
company of 1.3125p per share.
High interest rates on cash deposits have also helped. The only black spot
has been its investment in Gestetner, where 1,500 shares, purchased at 183p
each, were sold for 132p each when I became concerned that Gestetner's
turnround (or takeover by Ricoh, its recent large investor) appeared to be
taking longer than I had hoped. I still feel that Gestetner is a reasonable
investment, taking a five-year view, but in current circumstances the
portfolio errs on the side of caution and prefers cash and other
investments.
In the summer Quarterly Review, I stated that the portfolio would consider
buying 1,000 shares in Fisons if they fell to around 175-185p and looked as
if they would not fall much further. Having correctly anticipated Fisons'
sharp falls earlier this year, but believing the company is basically sound,
when the shares reached 168p on August 28 the portfolio made its purchase.
This is still a high-risk investment. If the shares fall to 130p and appear
to be on a continuing downward path, then they will be sold. I hope,
however, that Fisons' plans to sell its horticultural interests will be
successful and a good price obtained, or that a much speculated takeover bid
may occur for the whole of Fisons.
With the September devaluation of the pound, Fisons' prospects ought to have
improved.
The portfolio will retain its shareholding in Pentland, despite its decision
not to proceed with the planned acquisition of Adidas sportswear. This
demonstrated the company's excellent reputation for caution, and Pentland
will benefit from a Pounds 20m foreign exchange profit on the aborted deal.
The continuing development of Speedo swimwear and Pentland's other interests
ought to make this company a good long-term investment. However, if Pentland
shares fell to 105p and looked as if a general market downturn would take
them lower, then the shares would be sold. (My own personal pension scheme
has a modest shareholding in Pentland).
Now, I have to consider what to do with the portfolio's remaining cash
holdings.
I asked a friend who works for a major international banking and
stockbroking firm what he is currently advising. He said: 'The quick profits
of the past are no longer to be anticipated. Rather than seeking profits,
people should be looking to conserve their wealth. It is all too easy to
lose money now.'
I tend to agree with him; but, as the portfolio has done so well so far, I
thought it ought to engage in a highly speculative gamble. Even if the
gamble does not work, at least the portfolio will not have lost all its
earlier gains.
The portfolio will risk Pounds 920 by buying 8,000 shares, at 11.5p each, in
a very small company, Burlington Group. It has a market capitalisation of
less than Pounds 2m. (My personal pension scheme has held shares in this
company since May 1989, when it was known as Gold and Base Metal Mines, but
has steadily increased its shareholding - still very modest - over the years
as the company sold its investments in overseas mining shares).
In his August 18 interim statement, the chairman of Burlington pointed out
that the company's 'portfolio retains substantial cash deposits and
short-dated gilt-edged investments . . . we will maintain a high liquidity
ratio.' The interim statement also revealed net assets per share of 17.52p
and after-tax profits for the six-month period of Pounds 41,500.
Burlington would seem to be ideal for someone wanting a company for a
reverse takeover, rather than risk the uncertainties and costs of a new
flotation. However, the shares should not be chased too far, as, in the
past, they have tended to rise and fall rapidly. For example, even this year
they have ranged between 7.5p and 14.5p.
The portfolio will also keep an eye on Allied Colloids. This appears to be a
very well-managed company engaged in the manufacture and sale of speciality
industrial chemicals. Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 28, 1992,
were Pounds 42.1m - an increase over the previous year of Pounds 3.2m. On
turnover of Pounds 254.5m, only Pounds 40.8m was in the UK. The rest was
overseas, so it should benefit from a devalued pound.
This year, the company's shares have traded in the 162p-220p range. If the
shares fell to around 170-180p, the portfolio would consider buying 1,000,
provided the economic situation did not look as if further sharp downturns
in markets were about to occur.
Thus, the portfolio maintains a fairly cautious approach, has a reasonable
amount of cash and has set limits at which it can divest itself of certain
investments before any catastrophic losses occur.
