FT  21 APR 94 / Tax concessions for shipping likely
Tory backbenchers campaigning for stronger support for the shipping industry
believe the government is set to announce a limited tax concession.
The Treasury is expected to extend the period during which tax relief can be
obtained under the rules governing the operation of capital allowances.
Expectations of a concession have been aroused by Sir Marcus Fox, chairman
of the backbench 1922 Committee. Unusually, he took a leading role in
seeking to secure more generous tax treatment for the industry during the
final stages of the finance bill. He joined other senior Tory MPs in backing
an attempt to improve the first year allowances for ships.
