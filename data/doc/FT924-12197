FT  22 OCT 92 / British tourist killed by gunmen on Egypt tour
A BRITISH tourist was killed and two wounded yesterday when gunmen opened
fire on a tour bus near the southern Egyptian town of Assiut - a hotbed of
Islamic extremism.
An official in Assiut said the woman tourist had died of wounds in hospital.
The incident could hardly be a worse advertisement for Egypt's lucrative
tourist industry expected to be worth some Dollars 3bn this year.
Tourism is easily the hard-pressed country's main foreign exchange earner.
Yesterday's shooting followed a similar episode earlier this month when
Moslem militants fired automatic weapons at a Nile cruiser with German
tourists on board.
Egyptian police said that gunmen ambushed the tour bus near the town of
Dayrut, some 270km south of Cairo. Dayrut has, for months, been the focus of
a bitter feud between Islamic militants and security forces, marked by
persistent violence.
The Egyptian government has been battling a resurgent Islamic movement whose
activities were brought into sharper focus by the recent earthquake, with
the authorities accusing fundamentalists of seeking to exploit the tragedy
for political purposes.
Disturbances on the streets of Cairo last weekend, apparently inspired by
Islamic militants and in which government relief efforts were openly
criticised, have been regarded as an ominous development.
