IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
13 STAR-EATING QUASARS FOUND 
British astronomers said last week that they had found 13 massive star-eating 
objects at the edge of the universe -- objects so powerful they consume the 
equivalent of a billion stars a year. 
The objects, known as quasars, are believed to be black holes formed by failed 
galaxies collapsing into themselves in the early stages of the universe's 
development, astronomer Michael Irwin told a meeting of the International 
Astronomical Union in Sydney, Australia. 
"We think quasars are galaxies that formed, but for some reason produced a big 
black hole in the middle that sucked in all the material and started emitting 
radiation," said Irwin. One such black hole is believed to inhabit the center 
of our galaxy. 
The newly discovered quasars are so far away it takes their light more than 13 
billion years to reach Earth. Consequently, they provide a window into what the 
universe looked like just one billion years after it was created 14 billion 
years ago.
