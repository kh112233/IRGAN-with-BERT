<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  Cancer is a highly complicated disease which completely 
differs in characteristics from such diseases as tuberculosis, 
which formerly was called the national disease of Japan, or more 
recently, AIDS. According to the "Science and Technology in the 
Year 2020" which was a survey study of anticipated technology 
published by the Science and Technology Agency in December 1992, 
tremendous efforts have been made to develop anti-cancer drugs, 
and great expectations are held for future developments. Up to 
this point in time, however, drugs have been largely ineffective 
for solid cancer, and external surgery and radiation (proton and 
electron) continue to hold an important role in actual 
treatment. There are some cancer cells that have a high 
resistance to radiation treatment, and because this resistance 
is considered to be a cause of recurrence, accelerated neutron 
beams having strong physiological effects are considered a more 
effective form of radiation, and are gaining greater use at the 
National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), at the 
Medical Science Research Laboratory, Tokyo University, as well 
as in Europe and the United States. 
  As a part of the 1976 bicentennial independence memorial 
activities in the United States, particle beam therapy research 
for the elimination of cancer was undertaken using 
[.sup]-[/] meson and heavy ion beams. More than 10 years 
ago in Japan, the Science and Technology Agency commissioned a 
survey study by the Japan Radiological Society relating to 
medical uses of accelerators as one link in the peaceful use of 
atomic energy. Selecting from [.sup]-[/] (negative pi 
meson) and heavy ions, the latter was given priority as the 
radiation for the 21st century. Based on this policy, the heavy 
ion synchrotron HIMAC is currently under construction at the 
National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), and the goal 
is to begin treatment of patients from the 1994 fiscal year. 
Elsewhere, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is using the 
synchrotron at Harvard University, and excellent results have 
been shown in the proton beam treatment of certain kinds of 
retinal cancer. From the results of these facilities, the 
Tsukuba University Particle Beam Medical Center was established 
in 1980, and experimental treatment began in 1983. This facility 
uses the 500 MeV proton beam from the booster synchrotron at the 
National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), and in 1990 
this center was reorganized into the current Research Center for 
the Medical Use of Proton Beams. Because positive results are 
being obtained which reflect on the kind of deep cancers, such 
as liver cancer, which continue to afflict many Japanese, this 
survey of the current trends in particle beam treatment places 
the emphasis on proton beam therapy. 
<H5>  II. Special Characteristics of Particle Beams Seen From the </H5>
Perspective of Cancer Treatment-LET and Bragg Peak 
  When X-rays and electrons penetrate into water (or into the 
human body), the water molecules along that path undergo 
electrolytic dissociation or excitation. This electrolytic 
dissociation or excitation is the principle effect by which the 
radiation beam affects the living body. Nuclear reactions have a 
vastly smaller cross-sectional area, and have been found to 
contribute little. The unit length along the routes of the 
radiation beam per energy given is called LET (Linear Energy 
Transfer). In X-rays and electrons, which are the conventional 
forms of therapeutic radiation, the dosage given attenuates 
almost exponentially as it progresses through the body from the 
point of irradiation (except for high energy X-ray buildup). 
Because radiation sensitivity depends on the kinds of tissue and 
cancer, treatments must, of course, be studied individually. 
Generally, however, the dosage distribution in which the dosage 
administered near the surface of the body attenuates almost 
exponentially the deeper it goes, is inappropriate for deeper 
cancers. Thus, at hospitals, variegated radiation from differing 
directions is performed by a lineac mounted on a rotating 
gantry, and the dosage on the skin is lowered while 
concentrating the dosage on the cancer. 
  Protons and particles with heavier electric charges 
(including [.sup]-[/]) have a range that corresponds to 
their energy when penetrating into water, and they have a large 
electrolytic dissociative action that is called the Bragg peak 
near the terminus of that range. From the point of entry through 
to this Bragg peak is a region of nearly fixed electrolytic 
dissociative action, and is called a plateau. As R. Wilson 
proposed in 1946, if proton energy is selected such that the 
Bragg peak agrees with the cancer, it would be possible to 
administer the dosage necessary for treatment of that cancer 
while doing very little damage to normal cells (Figure 1). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Comparison of Dosage Distribution When Proton 
Beams, X-rays, _g_-rays and Electron Beams Pass 
Through Tissue&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  From the results of research at Uppsala, Sweden, etc., the 
LET of protons is lower than that of neutrons and heavy ions, 
and it was clarified that the physiological effects RBE 
(Relative Biological Effectiveness) is almost equal to that of 
conventional radiation. Ordinarily, RBE is expressed by the 
dosage ratio of the protons (or other particle beams) and [.sup]60[/] 

Co (or X-rays) in which 10 percent of the 
irradiated cells survive (Figure 2). The larger the surviving 
fraction of cells at low dosage, the larger this dosage ratio. 
In low LET radiation, curved parts appear on the recovery in the 
low dosage regions as indicated in the survival curves of Figure 
2, and because there is no recovery in high LET radiation, the 
survival curve becomes a straight line. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Cell Survival Curve When Irradiating With 
Neutrons and X-rays of Differing Energy&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  There is something in cancer cells that shows a strong 
resistance to conventional radiation, and this is thought to be 
a cause of recurrence after a part has gotten well by radiation 
therapy. Moreover, the radiation resistance of cells depends on 
the oxygen concentration of the environment which surrounds the 
cell, and it is known that when cancer cells are in a low oxygen 
state, the resistance to radiation becomes stronger (OER: Oxygen 
Enhancement Ratio). Particle beams with a high LET also have a 
high RBE, and the capacity by which cancer cells are injured is 
not affected by the oxygen concentration to the same degree as 
in conventional radiation. Consequently, it is thought that high 
LET particle beams are probably more effective on radiation 
resistance cancer. Thus, even though they are not electrically 
charged particle beams, high LET accelerated neutron beams are 
used in therapy. The radiation used in therapy is classified as 
follows. 
  Low LET radiation: photon, n, p, He, [.sup]-[/] 
plateau. 
  High LET radiation: n, C, O, ... Si, Ne, Ar, etc. 
  heavy ions, [.sup]-[/] star. 
<H5>  III. Accelerated Neutron Beams </H5>
  The dosage distribution of accelerated neutrons is not 
greatly different from conventional radiation, and attenuates 
almost exponentially in the body. Accelerated neutron beam 
therapy was conducted at Berkeley even before the war, but all 
the patients died. After the war, they were begun again at 
Hammersmith Hospital in England, and because positive results 
were reported, the specialized cyclotrons at NIRS and at the 
Medical Science Research Laboratory, University of Tokyo were 
introduced in Japan, and therapy began being conducted. However, 
a significant difference in effectiveness compared to 
conventional radiation was found only in cancers of extremely 
limited positions such as salivary glands, pancoast lung cancer, 
and the prostate gland, etc. Up to this point, approximately 
10,000 people in the world have received accelerated neutron 
therapy, but compared to conventional radiation, it is said that 
there is greater tardive injury, and these clinical results 
strongly suggest the effectiveness of high LET radiation. 
Treatments have already been terminated at the Medical Science 
Research Laboratory, University of Tokyo. 
<H5>  IV. Proton Beams </H5>
  Proton beams belong to low LET radiation, and have 
physiological characteristics similar to X-rays and electron 
beams. Based on these characteristics, H. Suit of MGH could 
anticipate the results and the injury involved in using proton 
beams, and was able to apply the experiences of conventional 
radiation therapy to the treatment of retinal melanoma using the 
160 MeV synchrocyclotron of Harvard University. The results were 
dramatic, and it was possible to not extract the eyeball, and to 
preserve vision. Fortunately, this cancer is rare in Asians, but 
the majority of proton beam treatment in the United States and 
Europe is targeted to this kind of patient (Table 1). 
Recognizing these results, custom proton beam treatment 
facilities have been newly built at MGH mentioned above, and at 
University of California Davis Cancer Center in Sacramento, 
California. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Table 1. History of Particle Beam Therapy&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In particle beam therapy, correct information about the 
position and size of the cancer is necessary, and this is 
possible by introducing computer tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). However, it was probably the brilliance 
of H. Suit to select the particular disease he did because 
retinal cancer can be accurately targeted without all this 
equipment. While some researchers believed proton beams to be 
effective only in cancers of the eye, it was the Tsukuba 
University Particle Beam Medical Center that tried applying the 
500 MeV proton accelerator at KEK to therapy by reducing the 
speed to 250 MeV. After 10 years, this Center became the 
Research Center for the Medical Utilization of Proton Beams in 
1990. In addition to the use of 500 MeV protons, pulse neutrons 
are being applied to biological research by the m Meson 
Group 
of Tokyo University. 
  The proton synchrotron operates about 4,000 hours annually, 
and this time is consumed in three periods of continuous 
operation punctuated with long periods of shutdowns. On the 
other hand, because one person receives a total of about 80 Gy 
radiation which is divided up into one dose per day for 20-30 
times, the number of patients treated per afflicted area is not 
that great, but already noteworthy results are being obtained 
(Table 2). 
  Specifically, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer, which are 
prevalent among Japanese, have a five year survival rate of 3 
percent, which is the worst among the cancers. Even with surgery 
and follow-up therapy, the possibility of recurrence is high. 
Liver cancer has not been a target for radiation therapy thus 
far, but if the liver function is good, the success is vastly 
improved as shown in the data marked in Table 2. It was 
demonstrated that even if the cancer is rather large, it can be 
controlled, and that treatment can also be applied to cases of 
recurrence (Figure 1).

&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Plan For Liver Cancer Treatment Based on a CT 
Image. When there are two points of entry for radiation, the 
irradiation of deep normal tissue rather than the cancer is 
prevented by manufacturing, from a material which has a 
radiation absorption factor equal to that of the tissue, a bolus 
that matches the shape of the cancer in each direction.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Irradiation by a proton beam during respiration has been 
accomplished for the first time. It can also be applied to 
inoperable esophageal cancers. Because there is little normal 
tissue damage compared to conventional radiation treatment, 
proton beam therapy has the great advantage that the patient 
undergoes no loss of hair or fatigue. Not only for cancer, 
attempts have been made to apply it to inoperable deformations 
of veins and arteries deep in the brain (Figure 2). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Deformation of Cerebral Arteries and Veins. Left 
photograph is before treatment, and right photograph is one year 
two months after. This differs from cancer in that therapy is 
complete after irradiating from several directions in one 
day.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In cancer treatment, it is necessary to have a uniform 
dosage 
distribution within a maximum volume of about 15 cm in each of 
the three dimensions. Because there is a time structure in the 
KEK booster synchrotron beam of many 10 ns pulses every 50 ms, 
the most simple radiation equipment is being adopted (Figure 3). 
Specifically, the proton beam is spread in the direction of 
progress and in a right angle direction by multiple Coulomb 
diffusion using a 6mm thick lead plate. The width of the 
operational amount is spread in the direction of progress by a 
ridge filter. Also, for the maximum adjustment of energy, 
plastic wedge-shaped fine degraders are used downstream from the 
lead scatterer. Then, a bolus (a bolus is a proton energy 
accumulator made by a process of cutting away a block of a 
material that resembles wax to match the shape of the cancer in 
the depth direction) is made to match the depth contour of the 
cancer, a slit is made to match the shape in the direction at 
right angles to the beam, and these are placed immediately 
before the patient. One dosage of radiation is approximately 2 
minutes, or if done during respiration, 5-10 minutes. Initially, 
only a vertical beam was used, but radiation from multiple 
angles is desirable in proton beams. Currently, a horizontal 
beam is also being used, and the frequency of use for both is 
about equal. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Irradiation System of the Vertical Beam 
Irradiation Room at the Research Center for Medical Utilization 
of Proton Beams, Tsukuba University. 250 MeV protons are 
irradiated by a system using a 90 deflection electromagnet, 
and the required proton beam distribution is formed using many 
kinds of equipment.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Initial data from Tsukuba was presented in the opening 
address at the first PTCOG (Proton Therapy Cooperative Group) 
Conference in January 1985. Loma Linda University, at the 
request of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, 
constructed a dedicated use proton therapy device whose 
principal accelerator is a compact synchrotron, and use for 
therapy began in 1990. Currently, the form of the accelerator is 
adapted to target prostate cancer. A 200 MeV synchrocyclotron in 
Orthez, France, was completely converted from nuclear physics 
research to medical use, and proton beam therapy began from 
1992. Melanoma of the retina is treated at several locations 
such as the PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute) in Switzerland. 
  Originally, the purpose of the KEK facility was to verify 
the 
efficacy of proton beams, and now that this has been verified, 
it is highly desirable to build a new dedicated use facility. 
However, the greatest problem is that both the scale and budgets 
for such a facility is markedly larger compared to conventional 
medical equipment. A synchrotron, cyclotron or lineac are all 
accelerators capable of producing for this amount of energy. The 
strength of the beam necessary for therapy is about 10 nA. The 
high strength beam acceleration of a lineac is capable of this, 
but because high frequency equipment is expensive, a unique 
synchrotron was designed at Tsukuba University with the 
cooperation of KEK. Subsequently, in future attempts to control 
a three dimensional beam, the manufacturer is studying the 
development of a commercial system which adds a rotating gantry 
to a compact cyclotron. 
<H5>  V. Negative Pi Meson </H5>
  A star (a `star' occurs when [.sup]-[/] is absorbed by 
the nucleus, the nucleus divides, and several lightweight 
particles are emitted in a radial shape) is produced when 
[.sup]-[/] energy is absorbed by the atomic nuclei 
composing the human body such as C, O, and N, and a mass of 140 
MeV is converted to energy. Because [.sup]-[/] is a large 
emitted energy, it was expected to have superior results, and 
clinical research was being conducted at all three of the 
world's meson sites; namely, Los Alamos in the United States, 
and PSI, and TRIUMF in Vancouver. In Japan, Dr. Yukawa predicts 
that meson radiation will gain social support as a clinical 
therapy. However, at Los Alamos this radiation was evaluated as 
not having the same efficacy as conventional radiation, and as 
indicated in Table 1, they quickly terminated research. The 
other two facilities are continuing, and PSI is combining this 
with proton beam therapy and TRIUMF is planning to do the same. 
  Because [.sup]-[/] is a secondary particle that is 
produced by high energy protons or electrons striking a target, 
the strength of the beam is weak; because it must be 
concentrated in a beam poor in mass, convergence is poor; and 
because the radiation time is long and their lifetime is short 
at 2.6 x 10-8 s, severe limitations are imposed on the radiation 
system. Furthermore, when stars are produced, there is high 
probability that two neutrons are released, and in that case, 
the dosage does not concentrate in the cancer. 
<H5>  6. Heavy Ions </H5>
  Biological and cancer treatment research using particle 
beams 
has been conducted at LBL (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory) for a 
long time. Progress has been made in clinical research using Ne 
in the heavy ion synchrotron BEVALAC. Because they have both a 
high LET and a Bragg peak, heavy ions including Ne are 
considered to be the ideal radiation which combines both a good 
dosage distribution and efficacy in relation to cancers with 
high radiation resistance. Therefore, the Science and Technology 
Agency is constructing a heavy particle beam cancer treatment 
device at NIRS as a part of its anti-cancer 10-year plan, and 
clinical research is to begin from the 1994 fiscal year. The 
results of Ne thus far have not always been satisfactory, and 
because the BEVALAC closed down in February, 1993, as previously 
described, and a proton beam facility is being planned for 
Sacramento, the NIRS facility will be the only heavy ion 
clinical research facility in the world, and its results will be 
closely watched. 
<H5>  7. Conclusions </H5>
  In order to make radiation treatment of cancer more 
effective, neutron, proton, [.sup]-[/], and heavy ion 
research are being conducted in addition to conventional proton 
and electron research, and from the rapid increase of facilities 
that have recently begun treatment, proton beam therapy is 
taking root as the next generation of practical radiation. 
Around the world, there are plans for at least 10 facilities at 
MGH, UC Davis Cancer Center, and Tsukuba University, etc., and 
it is highly desirable to develop a medical dedicated use proton 
beam facility that fulfills the difficult conditions of compact 
size, low cost, and high reliability. 
  Finally, I would like to take the opportunity of this 
presentation to give heartfelt thanks to Director Yoshihisa 
Wakuto and Manager Masaji Sakae of the Kyushu Energy Institute 
which provided the opportunity for this presentation, and to 
Office Manager Moriyama and all related parties of the Kyushu 
Atomic Energy Forum. 
  Postscript: At the 18th PTCOG Conference convened 15-19 
April 
1993 in France, it was clarified that PSI will terminate 
[.sup]-[/] therapy, and that half of the operational time 
of the superconductor cyclotron AGOR recently completed in 
Holland will be offered for proton beam therapy.
