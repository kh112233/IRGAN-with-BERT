FT  06 MAR 93 / Levels of ozone hit record low
OZONE levels over much of Europe and North America were the lowest on record
last month, falling more than a fifth below normal, and have been
persistently below normal this winter.
Revealing the figures yesterday, the World Meteorological Organisation said
possible causes were the continuing release of ozone-destroying chemicals
into the earth's atmosphere and winter weather conditions which have pushed
ozone-poor air north from the sub-tropical Atlantic.
High-level ozone filters harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun, which can
damage plant, marine and animal life and cause skin cancers and cataracts in
humans.
The UN agency stressed that the northern hemisphere was not experiencing
massive ozone destruction of the kind that has produced an ozone 'hole' over
the Antarctic. It said there was no need for special precautions against
extra ultra-violet radiation, since little reached the earth's surface in
winter. The periods of low ozone were short, the sun was low in the sky and
the weather was often cloudy.
