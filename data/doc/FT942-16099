FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Leisure behind Gowrings' gain
Gowrings, the motor trading and leisure company, reported a turnround from
losses of Pounds 82,000 to profits of Pounds 251,000 pre-tax in the 1993
year.
The result was achieved on higher turnover of Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 52.2m)
and helped by a lower interest charge of Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 718,000) and
higher exceptional credits of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 42,000).
There was continued sustained growth in the leisure division, particularly
food services. However, the motor side saw severe pressure on margins
resulting in lower profits.
Earnings per share were 2.29p (losses 1.4p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 1p is proposed for a maintained total of 2p.
The company is selling a mobile home park near Oxford for Pounds 825,100,
against a book value of Pounds 1.01m. It was originally acquired for Pounds
383,000 and in 1993 generated net profits of Pounds 6,000.
