FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Equity share a pragmatic solution for borrowers
Sir, Your leader, 'The next step in housing' (June 2), implies that the
improvement in repossession trends in the first few months of the year owes
much to the direct payments of mortgage interest for income recipients and
the counselling and renegotiation for borrowers in arrears.
While one cannot under-estimate the importance of financial advice to home
owners experiencing mortgage difficulties, in real terms the option of
renegotiating a mortgage in such a way that it would have a discernible
effect on reducing monthly payments is limited.
Any notion that borrowers are 'reluctant to rejoin the tenantry' is
completely unfounded. An increasingly significant number of borrowers in
arrears see equity-share as the only pragmatic solution which allows them to
retain their home without undue financial hardship.
Quite apart from this, lending institutions would be short-sighted to
dismiss equity share as economically unfavourable for they are well aware
that a glut of devalued properties does little to inspire confidence in an
already unstable house market.
