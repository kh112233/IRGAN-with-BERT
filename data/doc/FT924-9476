FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Congress incumbents hang on but
many terms are limited
ASK American voters what they think of Congress members in general and they
will boo; ask them what they think about their own member in particular and
they will cheer.
Campaign strategists and political pundits agreed that this conventional
wisdom would be turned on its head this year by a wave of anger against
incumbents.
In fact, incumbents fought back, often against damaging personal accusations
and strong challengers, to win re-election. Voters still booed incumbents in
general, by voting overwhelmingly to limit the number of terms that can be
served by elected officials in each of 14 states that had such a proposition
on the ballot.
But, for the most part, they cheered their own representatives, re-electing
most of the incumbents who had seemed at risk.
Many members of Congress saw their electoral majorities reduced, and two
dozen incumbents were defeated in the House of Representatives - a
substantial figure, but a far cry from the dire predictions.
Prominent victims included Mr Richard Ray of Georgia's third Congressional
district, an important voice on defence issues, and Mr Thomas Downey of New
York, a member of the House Ways and Means committee who, only 43, had
served 18 years in the House and built a reputation as a substantial author
of legislation.
Public outrage over the abuse of the generous overdraft facilities for
members by the House's private bank continued to wreak havoc. Among its
victims were Ms Mary Rose Oakar and Mr Bob McEwen, both of Ohio, while Mr
Nicholas Mavroules in Massachusetts and Mr Albert Bustamante in Texas were
laid low by broader accusations of financial misdeeds.
In the Senate, North Carolina voters were deterred from re-electing Mr Terry
Sanford by his recent heart surgery, while Wisconsin's electorate spurned
Senator Bob Kasten in favour of Mr Russ Feingold. Mr John Seymour, as
expected, failed to hold the Senate seat to which Mr Pete Wilson appointed
him when he himself left the Senate to become governor of California.
Yet endangered incumbents from both parties, such as Republican Newt
Gingrich in Georgia and Democrat Romano Mazzoli in Kentucky shook off their
challengers.
None of the senior House leaders who had been tipped as possible upsets,
such as Speaker Tom Foley, Ways and Means committee chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, or Armed Services committee chairman Les Aspin, was defeated.
In the upper chamber, too, Senator John Glenn survived in Ohio, although his
involvement with Mr Charles Keating, head of a collapsed savings and loan
body, stripped him of some of his space hero's aura.
The new House of Representatives is expected to have 105 new members, nearly
a quarter of its 435 total. The 100-member Senate, which elects a third of
its members for six-year terms in every two-yearly election, will see 11 new
members.
Overall, the Congress will wear a different face, with greatly increased
representation for women, Hispanics and African-Americans.
This is particularly true for the Senate. Ms Barbara Mikulski, one of only
two women in the Senate, easily won re-election in Maryland. She will be
joined by two newly elected Democratic women from California - Ms Dianne
Feinstein and Ms Barbara Boxer - as well as by Ms Patty Murray from
Washington state and Ms Carol Moseley Braun from Illinois. Ms Braun will be
the first black woman US senator.
For all this change, and despite the election of a Democrat to the White
House for the first time in 12 years, the new Congress may be prone to the
gridlock that agitated voters during the campaign.
The Democrats will retain solid control of the House. With a few seats still
outstanding, their majority was expected to shrink to from 266 to 259, with
Republican representation growing from 166 to 175. There is also one
independent, Mr Bernard Sanders, the socialist member for Vermont.
In the Senate, the Democrats have, so far, a net gain of one seat. That
could be negated, however, for Senator Wyche Fowler of Georgia narrowly
failed to win an outright majority, and must proceed to a run-off against Mr
Paul Coverdell.
In any event, the Democrats have failed to achieve the 60-member majority
needed to override filibusters. This failure could put a brake on their
ability to push through a sweeping legislative agenda.
Democrats won eight of the 12 governorships up for election on Tuesday,
picking up North Carolina, Missouri and Delaware from the Republicans, but
losing North Dakota.
