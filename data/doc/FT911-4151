FT  20 APR 91 / Antarctic plan
Britain yesterday effectively rejected proposals to turn Antarctica into a
world park. Foreign minister Tristan Garel-Jones said countries proposing
the scheme had not explained how it would be administered.
Officials from countries which have signed the Antarctic Treaty will meet in
Madrid next week to debate the future of the southern wilderness.
