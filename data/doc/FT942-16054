FT  12 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Canadian debt reviewed
Moody's Investors Service, the international credit rating agency, has put
its triple-A rating for Canadian foreign currency debt on review for
possible downgrade.
Approximately Dollars 8.5bn of debt is affected, including bonds issued by
the Canadian government, the Export Development Corporation and the Federal
Business Development Bank.
While the agency acknowledged a moderate upturn in the Canadian economy and
said it expected a slight improvement in the current account deficit in
1994, it said the public sector debt question was complicated by the fact
that foreigners have been buying an ever-larger portion of Canadian public
sector debt.
'The rising concern about the level of public sector finance within Canada
appears to pose a risk that, during a period of stress, holders of Canadian
dollar-denominated debt might turn those assets into foreign currency
assets.'
Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the Canadian government's foreign debt from
triple-A to double-A-plus in October 1992.
