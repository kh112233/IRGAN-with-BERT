FT  04 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
Wool prices have risen at auctions in Australia and New Zealand this week,
taking the market close to, if not aligned with, seasonal peaks. The
Australian Wool International indicator at 535 cents compares with 546
touched early in February, and New Zealand prices have risen particularly
strongly with much better clearances than for some time. The market upturn
has developed despite an Australian clip forecast which raises expected
production this season, thus increasing offerings in the next four months,
and also indicates a smaller decline than expected in production next
season. there are still difficulties in selling semi-processed and
manufactured wool textiles at prices reflecting recent costs, but the
balance does this week seem to favour continuing market recovery rather than
any new setback.
