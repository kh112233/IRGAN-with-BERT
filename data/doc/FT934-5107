FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Beer unchanged - Duty
For the first time in five Budgets, the duty on beer is not increased and
spirits duty is also unchanged. But wine and cider prices go up from January
1 in line with inflation.
The changes add 2p to a 75cl bottle of table wine and 4p for sparkling wine.
Cider goes up 1p for a two-litre bottle.
The chancellor estimates that the revenue changes on drinks will have only a
negligible impact on the retail price index.
Duties on tobacco went up from 6pm yesterday.
The price of 20 cigarettes, raised by 10p in the March Budget, rose a
further 11p to around Pounds 2.52p.
The price of five small cigars rose 5p and of 50 grams of pipe tobacco by
14p on a 7.3 per cent increase in duty.
The price of hand-rolled tobacco went up 32p for a 50-gram packet.
Tobacco duty will be raised each year from now on by an average of at least
3 per cent a year in real terms.
