FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: RJ Reynolds plans plant
RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group,
announced yesterday that it plans to build a factory in Turkey to produce
cigarettes by late 1993.
The North Carolina company says the plant will have an eventual production
capacity of 10bn cigarettes a year. The 135,000 sq ft plant will be sited in
the Izmir region. The company said that it had earmarked more than Dollars
100m for investment in Turkey over the next decade.
Turkey is a big market for cigarettes, and consumption is estimated at 80bn
a year. However, it is still dominated by Tekel, the state-owned monopoly.
The market was only opened to foreign cigarettes in the mid-1980s, but
western products have taken an increasing market share. Philip Morris, RJR's
big US competitor and manufacturer of Marlboro, has been successful.
RJR, however, said that it saw opportunities for its three brands - Camel,
Winston, and Salem. It expects to employ 300 people initially at the
factory, but said employment could eventually total about 800.
Mr Dale Sisel, head of RJ Reynolds Tobacco International, said: 'It's a
large market, with significant demand for American-blend cigarettes, and
there's plenty of opportunity for us to become a major participant.'
