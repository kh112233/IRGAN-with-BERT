PROS AND CONS OF DECRIMINALIZING DRUGS THE IN U.S. 
How refreshing to have so much discourse on drugs and legalization (Drugs: 
America Looks for the Way Out, Op-Ed Page, March 12-21). Now, maybe we can try 
something new instead of staying with laws that haven't worked. 
Regarding the numerous authors: Carol Tavris ("Drop the Iron Fist and Try Rules 
of Moderation," March 19) was the most intelligent and should be our new drug 
czar. Terry Williams ("A World Bank for Inner-City Kids," March 19) should know 
that smoking cocaine in crack form screws up people beyond measure -- and comes 
close when it isn't in crack form -- which is why smart people like myself 
would never do that. Free use of some drugs legally, with education, need not 
be tainted by heroin or crack, which owe their markets to addicted abusers 
rather than recreational users, like pot smokers. Police Chief Daryl Gates 
(March 15) spouted off the same old "party line" which is no surprise, but 
totally useless.
