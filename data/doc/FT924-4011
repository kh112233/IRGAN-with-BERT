FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (5): Treacly rival to coal and oil - The
potential and pitfalls of a new fuel from the Orinoco
IN the mid-1980s, Venezuela's PDVSA and BP developed a new fuel called
Orimulsion.
Orimulsion, now registered by PDVSA as a trade name, is an emulsion made up
of approximately 70 per cent natural bitumen by volume, and 30 per cent
water, plus a surfactant, or additive to keep the mixture stable.
It is being marketed as a fuel for electric power generation plants and
other industrial facilities that generate power.
The motivation for developing this fuel came from the huge reserves of
bitumen and extra-heavy crude oil that Venezuela possesses in the Orinoco
Belt, the world's largest deposits of their type.
PDVSA has estimated that the Orinoco Belt holds 1.2 trillion barrels of
bitumen and heavy oil in place, and that around 270bn barrels can be
recovered for commercial use.
Orimulsion has been tested commercially in Canada, Japan and the UK, and
PDVSA has signed long-term contracts to supply the product to power plants
in these countries and Spain. PowerGen's Ince B plant is one of the plants
in Britain where Orimulsion is used.
In 1991, PDVSA produced 1.1m tonnes of Orimulsion, four times its output the
previous year. Sales to international clients reached 885,000 tonnes in
1991, up 700,000 tonnes from 1990.
Through its subsidiary Bitor, as well as joint ventures between Bitor, BP
and Mitsubishi, PDVSA is aggressively marketing Orimulsion internationally.
The company's goal is to be producing - and selling - around 41m tonnes per
annum by 1996.
PDVSA is pushing Orimulsion as an economical, long-term alternative to coal
and fuel oil. It can be transported and stored like fuel oil, and, unlike
coal, does not raise dust during transportation.
The company says that relatively small investments are required to adapt
plants that burn fuel oil to Orimulsion. However, some serious questions
have been raised in the US and the UK about pollution problems that might be
associated with this new fuel, including emissions of sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide (the two main acid rain gases), particles and others.
PDVSA asserts that Orimulsion compares favourably with other fossil fuels in
terms of environmental impact.
Citing the results of independent tests and commercial applications, PDVSA
says that Orimulsion produces levels of sulphur dioxide emissions that are
lower than those produced by 2.5 per cent sulphur coal and slightly higher
than 3.5 per cent sulphur fuel oil.
It also asserts that Orimulsion's high caloric value means that lower
volumes will be burned (and thus less sulphur dioxide released) than by
fuels with less caloric value, to generate the same amount of energy.
As for nitrogen oxide emissions, PDVSA states that Orimulsion produces less
than coal and the same or less than fuel oil. The company says that
Orimulsion burned in conventional power stations produces about 20 per cent
less carbon dioxide than equivalent coal-fired stations, and levels similar
to plants burning fuel oil.
Particle emissions, PDVSA states, are 'well within the strictest limits set
by developed industrialised countries", and acid smuts are unlikely in power
stations burning Orimulsion.
In test spills, a high percentage of Orimulsion disperses of its own accord,
the company says.
At the same time, PDVSA's R&amp;D unit, Intevep, has produced a 'second
generation' of Orimulsion that is supposed to be cleaner than the first.
