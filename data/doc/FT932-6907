FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Digital's South African unit to
open in July
DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer group, is to open a wholly-owned
subsidiary in South Africa, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg. The new
subsidiary, Digital Sales &amp; Services South Africa, will begin operations on
July 1.
Digital estimates South Africa's annual investment in information technology
is Dollars 1.7bn, making it the largest market in the world without a
Digital presence.
'Many of our major international customers operate here and they have asked
Digital to come and support them as we do elsewhere,' said Mr Alberto
Fresco, Digital Europe's vice-president.
Digital, the world's third-largest computer company, said it had been
monitoring the economic, political and social climate in South Africa for
two years and decided it was time to participate.
The new subsidiary would offer Digital's full range of open, networked
computer systems, services and systems integration for personal computers to
mainframes.
Mr Alan Peters of Digital Europe has been made general manager of the
subsidiary. The majority of employees would be South African.
Ms Sallie Crenshaw, Digital's international trade director, said the company
would begin with 50 employees, including four senior US-based Digital
managers who would help set up the local operation and develop their local
management replacements before returning to the US.
The company hoped to have 200 local employees by 1996. 'We hope this will
send a signal of commitment and confidence to other foreign investors
considering the South African market,' she added.
