FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): IBM - Other Companies
International Business Machines will report its first quarter results on
Friday with investors anxious to hear whether the struggling computer
manufacturer has achieved even a meagre net profit in what is traditionally
its slowest sales period of the year.
The consensus on Wall Street is that IBM should report net earnings per
share of about 8 cents, on revenues of about Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.90bn)
for the quarter. This would represent a turnaround from last year's first
quarter when the company reported net losses of Dollars 399m or 70 cents per
share after a charge of Dollars 114m for retirement health benefits.
Most analysts believe that the worst is over for IBM, after three years of
heavy losses culminating with last year's record loss of Dollars 8.1bn,
including an Dollars 8.9bn restructuring charge.
