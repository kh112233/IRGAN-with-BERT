THE TIMES SHOPPER: SEARCHING FOR ANTIQUES AMONG THE ROCKFORD FILES 
If you're looking for a terrific mementos of turn-of-the-century antiques, head 
for this friendly industrial city about 75 miles northwest of Chicago. 
Rockford's population of roughly 148,000 supports two sizable antiques malls 
with nearly 200 dealers, two Saturday and Sunday antiques flea markets with 
dozens of dealers and more than a dozen individual antique shops. 
They sell all sorts of American antiques, including furniture, farm equipment, 
kitchen utensils, gadgets, books, prints, toys, clothing and personal 
accessories. 
Quality and condition of goods vary greatly from shop to shop, but prices are 
reasonable. That's because local dealers have purchased items directly from the 
attics and basements of families whose ancestors settled the town. 
This concentration of antiques outlets is only one aspect of Rockford's romance 
with the past. Before touring the shops, take time to absorb the city's 
fascinating history by browsing through several landmark sites, each lovingly 
restored and/or preserved by volunteer groups. 
Blacksmith's Shop 
Midway Village, a collection of turn-of-the-century buildings, gives visitors a 
glimpse into Rockford's past. It includes a post office, lawyer's and doctor's 
offices, a bank, blacksmith's shop, schoolhouse and church -- all with antique 
furnishings. 
Tinker Swiss Cottage, a chalet-like residence built in 1865, provides a look at 
a wealthy Rockford family's Victorian life style. The Coronado Theater, an 
ornate 1925 vaudeville auditorium, has its original twinkling stars in the 
ceiling, gilded gargoyles of Abraham Lincoln and an organ that reproduces such 
sounds as thunder and sirens for accompanying silent films. 
Much of the antique furniture housed in these landmarks was donated by Rockford 
families, who were also sources for local antique dealers.

two-level shop at the Clock Tower Inn (7801 E. State St.) displays a stunning
