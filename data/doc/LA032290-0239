U.S. CITES 'MAJOR' HEALTH ISSUE, EXPANDS RECALL OF L-TRYPTOPHAN 
The federal government said today the dietary supplement L-tryptophan poses a 
"major public health problem" and expanded its recall because of indications 
that even small doses can cause a sometimes fatal blood disorder. 
"We are confronted with a major public health problem," warned Health and Human 
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, in the FDA's announcement. 
"I urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately." 
L-tryptophan, which is sold over the counter and used by some for insomnia, 
depression, premenstrual syndrome and appetite control, has been linked to a 
blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS. Reports of the 
disorder have climbed to 1,411, with 19 deaths, the FDA said. Cases have been 
reported in every state. 
The FDA initially recalled only the larger dose forms of the product, those 
that would result in daily intake of 100 milligrams or more a day. 
However, at least one case of the disorder has been reported in which the 
individual had taken less than 100 milligrams of the supplement daily, the FDA 
said. 
EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing difficulties, swelling 
of the arms and legs, skin rash and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims 
show signs of congestive heart failure and paralysis.
