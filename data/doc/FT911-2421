FT  30 APR 91 / More help offered to Third World cities
THE World Bank has agreed to change its policies towards urban development,
in the light of the rapid growth of Third World cities, bank officials said
yesterday.
The bank has been trying to address urban problems mainly through lending
for housing and other narrowly-based projects.
The new approach, taking account of the expectation that by 2000 half the
population in the Third World will live in cities, will attempt to make
urban development an important component of its overall development
strategy.
It will aim to encourage the improvement of urban productivity and reduce
the impediments to growth.
The focus would include attempts to lighten the regulatory restrictions on
growth of private businesses, to tackle the weakness in many local
governments and to address weak financial systems.
A new emphasis would be tackling urban poverty. The bank would also focus on
arresting and reversing the environmental deterioration which accompanied
rapid urban growth.
Peter Norman reports: Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, yesterday
suggested a World Bank 'fund, facility or subsidiary' to back long-term
Middle East development after the Gulf war.
He told the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee
that the new facility should be supported by or co-ordinated with the IMF.
Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, French finance minister, said yesterday he saw no
need for a new lending institution for the Middle East. Instead, the
industrialised nations should co-operate closely to help the region and the
Maghreb of North Africa, also badly hit by the effects of the Gulf war.
