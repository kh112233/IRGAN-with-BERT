FT  15 NOV 93 / Structural maladjustment and the CFA franc
MR Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's finance minister through what now amounts to 11
years of market-based economic reform, has a favoured response to those who
criticise his willingness to swallow the bitter medicine advocated by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 'Structural adjustment is
very painful,' he willingly acknowledges, 'but structural maladjustment is
much worse.'
World Bank officials, chastened after Africa's dismal economic performance
over the past 'structural adjustment' decade, are quick to echo Mr
Botchwey's words. Of course, structural adjustment is not the answer to
Africa's ills. The effects of short-sighted developed-country trade policies
and decades of under-investment in education, health and institutional
capacity will take many years to reverse. But structural adjustment, while
far from sufficient, remains necessary: without adjustment measures to free
prices, make real interest rates positive and deliver a competitive exchange
rate, the chances of investment- and export-led growth in sub-Saharan Africa
are negligible.
But there is one, compelling, piece of evidence in support of adjustment
that the World Bank and the IMF are, in public, cautious about highlighting:
the deepening economic crisis in francophone west Africa. Originally a
source of low inflation and economic stability, the combination of the
French government's franc fort policy and falling commodity prices has
delivered deepening deflation among the 14 members of the the Communaute
Financiere Africaine (CFA), who have kept their currencies pegged to the
French franc at the same official rate since 1948.
Structural maladjustment - in this case a 30 per cent appreciation in the
real exchange rate since 1985 - has rendered much of francophone Africa's
exports uncompetitive. Average government and manufacturing wages in
Senegal, relative to average incomes, are three to six times higher than in
Indonesia or Ghana. Not surprisingly, the majority of the budget goes to pay
the salaries of the urban elite which are then used to buy provide cheap
French imports. The losers are the rural masses, whose access to primary
education is low even by African standards.
The Bank and the Fund, under heavy French pressure not to rock the boat, are
wary of highlighting the CFA franc's overvaluation. But the truth slips out.
In a well-argued paper, published by a US-based pressure group, Mr Ishrait
Husain, chief economist in the World Bank's Africa department but writing in
a personal capacity, has compared the economic performance of the CFA member
countries with 14 countries which have pursued structural adjustment in the
1980s. The adjusters saw growth accelerate to an average 4.5 per cent a year
between 1986 and 1991. Over the same period, output in the CFA fell by an
average 0.2 per cent a year. The CFA countries have the potential to perform
much better, Mr Husain and his co-author argue, 'but their progress will
remain muted until the competitiveness issue is resolved.'*
The French government has publicly denied rumours in the French press that a
devaluation is planned for the new year. But there are signs that change may
be afoot. In August, the CFA member countries banned the repurchase of
CFA-franc notes outside the zone in an attempt to stem capital flight, but
the CFA franc is now trading at a 45 per cent discount on the black markets
of Lagos and Accra.
Meanwhile, the French government has told CFA zone finance ministers that,
in future, they must reach agreements with the IMF before French aid will
become available, suggesting that France may be moving towards endorsing the
private view of the international financial institutions that some form of
devaluation is inevitable. The political and economic difficulties of a
co-ordinated CFA devaluation are huge. But, as Europe learned this summer,
ignoring the need for a realignment will not make the problem go away.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade
figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the
German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.
