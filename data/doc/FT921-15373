FT  10 JAN 92 / Salinas moves to end deadlock in fight against air pollution
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has set up a commission to co-ordinate
Mexico City's fight against air pollution, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.
The commission, to be headed initially by Mr Manuel Camacho, the capital's
mayor, will include five cabinet ministers, the governor of the state of
Mexico, the director of Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, and local ecologists.
It will start with a budget of the equivalent of Dollars 165m (Pounds 91m),
half of which will be financed by the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
The new body has been created to avoid the inter-ministerial rivalry
hampering the design and implementation of the existing pollution programme,
which has been costed at Dollars 4.6bn.
