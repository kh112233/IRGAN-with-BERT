FT  14 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System
The D-Mark last week climbed above the Belgian franc to third place in the
EMS grid, bolstered by the slow pace of Bundesbank monetary easing and a
weaker US dollar. The Portuguese escudo slipped below the Spanish peseta at
the bottom end of the grid. The Irish punt remains the strongest currency,
but is now only marginally ahead of the Dutch guilder.
