FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unit trust buying practice at heart
of system
Sir, Mr Landman (Letters, October 26) has misunderstood the roles both of
unit trust managers and of stockbrokers and marketmakers in running
principal positions.
Far from being punished, as he suggests, such behaviour is at the heart of
the trading system at the London Stock Exchange and many other financial
markets, where liquidity is provided by firms which are willing to take a
risk using their professional judgment of the market and buying and selling
for their own account.
When unit trust managers take principal positions (which they have to do,
for example, if they are to deal on a historic basis, a service appreciated
by many private investors), the interests of investors are fully
safeguarded.
The price which an investor pays for units or receives for selling them is
carefully regulated through detailed pricing rules drawn up and imposed by
the regulatory authorities. The price will be within the same parameters
regardless of whether units are created or cancelled with the trustee or the
manager sells on units which have previously been sold back to him.
The independent corporate trustee who must be authorised under the Financial
Services Act 1986 holds the unitholders' assets and has a responsibility to
ensure that investors' interests are kept paramount.
If there is a fall in the market, the manager takes a loss and if he sells,
the price he receives is again calculated according to the pricing
regulations: he will receive the cancellation price applicable at that time.
Investors are unaffected.
