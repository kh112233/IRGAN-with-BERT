FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: World Bank advocates openness
Sir, Michael Holman raises a complex and difficult issue in his opinion on
the World Bank and access to economic information in Africa ('World Bank's
worst-kept secrets', March 2).
In general, we agree with his call for as much openness as possible. As he
acknowledges, the bank already makes available a great deal of economic
information on Africa and other developing regions. However, he would like
us to go further and publish confidential economic analysis of individual
countries, even when the government opposes publication. It should be
understood that while the bank encourages the release of pertinent country
economic information and analysis, we cannot impose our wishes upon
sovereign governments.
But it is wrong to assume - simply because much of the economic policy
dialogue takes place out of the public eye - that, therefore, the bank's
relationships with some governments are 'unhealthy'. As many governments
would testify, the bank is very forthright in offering its candid economic
analysis - and making its financial support contingent on reforms being
implemented to address identified problems.
It should also be noted that the bank has been, and continues to be, a
strong advocate of greater openness in borrowing member countries because it
believes these principles are directly linked to sustainable development.
