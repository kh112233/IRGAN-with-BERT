FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Medeva chief goes as rise of 28% to Pounds
46m is shown
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the entrepreneur who founded Medeva, the acquisitive
pharmaceuticals group, is resigning his executive position nine months after
a profit warning which halved the share price.
Mr Gowrie-Smith, managing director, and his long-time business partner Mr
David Lees, who is resigning as finance director to be succeeded by Mr
Dennis Millard, will continue to provide the group with 'acquisition
services' on a consultancy basis. Mr Gowrie-Smith will remain a
non-executive director.
The resignations came as Medeva announced a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 46.1m for 1993.
In July it warned that profits would be about Pounds 10m lower than
analysts' expectations of Pounds 53m-Pounds 57m largely due to problems at
two US subsidiaries.
Sales rose 39 per cent to Pounds 200.4m on the back of organic growth but
excluding exchange rate movements of 20 per cent. Earnings fell 4 per cent
to 11.8p due partly to a higher tax charge. The final dividend is 1.8p
(1.5p) for a 2.7p (2.25p) total.
Mr Bernard Taylor, brought in as chairman in 1990, insisted that the
resignations were not linked to the problems the group encountered last
year. He denied there had been any pressure on the two to go.
Although it is an open secret that Mr Taylor found it hard to work with Mr
Gowrie-Smith, sources close to the company also insisted that the
resignations were voluntary.
Mr Gowrie-Smith said that he had approached Mr Taylor in April or May,
before the problems arose, asking to end his managerial role.
Both Mr Gowrie-Smith and Mr Lees will receive Pounds 30,000 in compensation
for loss of office and have been granted three-year consultancy agreements.
These provide for initial payments of Pounds 286,000 and Pounds 230,000 and
payments over the next three years totalling a minimum of Pounds 700,000 and
Pounds 400,000 respectively. Mr Gowrie-Smith received a salary of about
Pounds 310,000 last year, down about 25 per cent.
Mr Taylor revealed that the group pulled out of a potential deal after the
shares slumped from 216p to 116p on the profit warning but said it still
needed to make acquisitions. Mr Gowrie-Smith said it could afford to make a
Pounds 100m purchase without issuing more shares.
The shares added 7p to 155p yesterday.
COMMENT
The rather modest rise in Medeva's share price yesterday may reflect the
fact that Mr Gowrie-Smith's move was seen as only a matter of time. There
were also a few negatives with the figures, which were boosted by booming
flu vaccine sales, including a year delay in the important hepatitis B
vaccine programme. On forecasts for the current year of about Pounds 54m the
shares are now on a multiple of about 12.5. There is plenty of scope for
further recovery.
