FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Samsung ambitions jeopardised by
state
DECISIONS taken last week by the South Korean government are likely to
jeopardise plans by Samsung, South Korea's second-largest business group, to
enter the passenger car industry.
Samsung's ambitions to become a car manufacturer aroused controversy after
it appeared to be preparing a hostile takeover bid for Kia Motors, the
country's second-biggest motor company.
Samsung has long sought to add vehicle production to its operations, which
include electronics, shipbuilding and construction.
It recently increased its shareholding in Kia to 9.6 per cent, making it
Kia's second-biggest shareholder after Ford Motor of the US.
However, Samsung agreed to reduce its shareholding under pressure from Kia
management and the government, which wants to curb the expansion of
conglomerates such as Samsung.
The government last week introduced shareholding rules making it impossible
for Samsung to attempt a takeover bid.
It ordered that institutional investors associated with conglomerates must
reduce their voting stake in other companies from the current 10 per cent
ceiling to 5 per cent by the end of June.
Samsung's stake in Kia was mainly held through Samsung Life Insurance.
The government action represented a reversal of its previous plans to lift
all shareholding restrictions next year, a measure seen as paving the way
for mergers and acquisitions in Korea.
Samsung's interest in taking over Kia was belived to be in its
car-production facilities. A takeover would have averted the need for heavy
capital spending on factories of its own, estimated to have costed up to
Dollars 2bn.
