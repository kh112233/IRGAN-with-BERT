FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: March plan for Kuwait
KUWAIT'S stock exchange, shut down since Iraq's 1990 invasion, will probably
reopen in March, Reuter reports.
Economists say that other measures to revive trading, including giving
foreigners access, could limit falls in some pre-war share prices to between
10 and 20 per cent.
Mr Hisham al-Otaibi, the director-general of the bourse, said officials were
awaiting audited financial reports from the 56 companies which were listed
prior to the invasion.
He expected the government to buy about Dollars 20bn of domestic bad debt
from commercial banks and investment firms to boost confidence, and to
provide support for shares in banks, the bourse's most active sector.
Kuwait's exchange, once the liveliest in the Gulf, had an annual turnover of
around Dollars 3bn before its closure.
