THE COCAINE WAR 
We should have a national debate on the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. If, 
after reviewing the choices, the people begin to react favorably to 
legalization, the politicians will be able to respond. 
Decriminalization does not condone drug use but, instead, recognizes the great 
peril that drugs are to all of society, especially to the youth of this nation. 
It will eliminate profit and reduce drug demand by providing money for 
prevention and treatment.
