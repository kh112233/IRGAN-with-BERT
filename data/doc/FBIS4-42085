  [Text] Paris, May 30 (AFP) -- The French Government is to 
make a gift of 25 million francs (4.47 million dollars) to help 
rebuild the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, the French Economy 
Ministry announced here Monday [30 May]. 
  The money will be targetted at the restoration of the 
electricity network around the war-shattered city. The work 
will be carried out by the French power group EDF. 
  Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said providing the money 
"demonstrates France's will to help the return of normal life in 
Sarajevo and the concern France has to be among the first to 
respond to the needs" of the Bosnian capital. 
  France's role in the two-year Bosnian conflict has dominated 
political debate here since a group of French intellectuals said 
they planned to enter a "Sarajevo list" of candidates for 
European Union elections on June 12 in order to highlight the 
fighting. 
  The list was withdrawn Monday though its organisers said 
they 
would continue campaigning, particularly for a lifting of the 
arms embargo on former Yugoslavia which they see as preventing 
the Bosnian authorities from defending their republic.
