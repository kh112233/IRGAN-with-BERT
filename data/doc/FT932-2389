FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Victaulic shock
Shares in Victaulic, the industrial products group, tumbled 62 to 253p after
it warned that first-half profits would be 20 per cent lower than a year
earlier.
The company, due to address analysts next week, cited delays in the
publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the future
structure of British Gas, a major customer, and lower than expected demand
from the water industry.
Williams Holdings added 7 at 309p after Strauss Turnbull advised investors
to switch out of TI Group, 7 lower at 338p.

the early part of the day, helped by the strong performance of Wall Street

got under way.
The two Zeneca stocks, strong performers in London late on Wednesday when
the Fleming buy note impacted on the market, initially edged higher before

SmithKline Beecham put on 5 at 451p and Glaxo managed to stay in positive
territory, rising marginally to 595p.
Another series of excellent results from the utilities ensured renewed
strong interest in the sub-sectors.

taking up the running after being left behind by the FT-SE 100 contituents.
Of the smaller stocks, Northumbrian was the best performer, closing 4 harder
at 581p. Southern eased 4 to 505p in spite of the 9.2 per cent increase in
the dividend total, at the top end of expectations.
Towards the close the sector retreated. Severn Trent Water, at 483p, gave up
13 of its recent advance: the preliminary figures, including the 9.3 per
cent rise in the dividend, were close to best expectations.
North West Water lost 7 to 467p, Anglian 8 to 476p and Thames 10 to 466p.
The electricity sector's 'dividend race' hotted up as South Wales

increase. But profit-taking in the electricity sector kept the lid on the
shares, which settled 2 easier at 546p.
An early rally ahead of a September dividend was said to be behind the
changing fortune of Dalgety, which strengthened 6 to 462p. Bensons Crisps
advanced 8 to 76p in anticipation of favourable comment and Booker

cent cross-shareholding. It moved up 6 to close at 495p in a volume of 3.2m.

A heavy two-way business was seen in Burton Group, which edged up  3/4 to 86
3/4 p as 17m shares were traded.
In a continued show of confidence following the better than expected interim
results, Granada Group added 5 at 420p.

acquisitive move for Savoy Hotel, whose 'A' stock climbed 30 to 835p while
Forte's share price slipped a penny to 219p.
The government's moves to amend the new Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) regime
was seen as good news for the smaller exploration companies by the leading
broking houses.
Mr Simon Flowers, exploration and production analyst at NatWest Securities,
said the news was 'particularly bullish for companies planning to spend up
to Pounds 10m on exploration over the next two years and which stand to pay
PRT in the near term'.
NatWest said virtually all smaller explorers will see their net asset values
boosted, and mentioned the clearest winners as Aran, Hardy and Goal. The
broker added that Lasmo and Enterprise would gain from the changes but that
their exploration budgets would be too large for the changes to be material.
Other brokers took the view that the changes were moderately positive.
Hardy Oil rose 6 to 168p, additionally helped by the results. Aran held at
33p and Goal edged up a penny to 64p.
