SYSTEM SHUT OFF, STABBING VICTIM DIES 
A 26-year-old stabbing victim whose life-support system was disconnected eight 
days ago over the objections of his assailant died Friday, nearly four years 
after the attack left him in a coma. 
Sylvia Lane said her son, Mark Weaver, died at about 2 a.m. "He died 
peacefully. He never had a moment's pain," she said. 
Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for stabbing Weaver during a 
street fight in 1985, fought unsuccessfully in court last week to force 
Weaver's family to keep him alive on a feeding tube. 
Prosecutors said Pagan, who is now on probation, could face a murder charge 
once Weaver died, but they need a cause of death before they can decide whether 
to seek charges. 
"The medical examiner will conduct an autopsy and make a report to us, and then 
we will make a decision," state Atty. Gen. James E. Tierney said Friday. 
Tierney declined to say what sort of finding would be necessary before a murder 
charge could be sought.
