FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J loss deepens after restructuring costs
Brown &amp; Jackson, the owner of the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores
which was recently rescued by Pepkor, the South African retail group, showed
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.7m for the six months to June 30.
The deficit, Pounds 1.3m greater than last time, included professional costs
of Pounds 1.4m for the financial restructuring. Turnover from continuing
operations was little changed at Pounds 57m.
Pepkor, which could inject up to Pounds 56.2m in return for a 63 per cent
stake in B&amp;J, said it had started its own review of the business. Changes
had already been made to reduce costs, increase stock densities and improve
net margins.
Financial difficulties since the year-end had led to some suppliers delaying
supplies, severely affecting customer service levels.
Losses per share were cut from 2.5p to 2p.
