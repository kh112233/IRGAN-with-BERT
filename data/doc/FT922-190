FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour women to flex poll muscle
LABOUR'S women MPs are planning to use their muscle for a collective assault
in the forthcoming elections to the shadow cabinet.
With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, the newly
energised women's committee believes that careful strategic voting might
even double female representation in the parliamentary leadership.
There are at present just four women occupants - Mrs Margaret Beckett, Ms
Ann Clwyd, Ms Ann Taylor and Ms Jo Richardson - of the 18 shadow cabinet
seats elected each year.
But at a Commons meeting of the committee last week, an outline plan was
agreed to try to secure six or more places when the votes are counted next
month.
Under Labour's rules - aimed at improving the gender balance - ballot papers
for shadow Cabinet positions are only valid when MPs have included at least
three votes for women. With 271 Labour MPs, that guarantees 813 votes for
women candidates.
The plan now being discussed by the group is to create a 'recommended' list
of women candidates and to ensure that others who might not normally be
expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their female
colleagues.
Labour's women MPs were wary of discussing the plan in detail yesterday, and
one prominent member of the women's committee insisted it was too early to
talk of a formal 'slate' being drawn up. That would suggest specific
candidates were being picked out, she said. Instead, women would merely be
asked to ensure that they included more than three votes for group members.
Beneficiaries might include Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Clare Short, Ms Marjorie
Mowlam and Ms Hilary Armstrong.
