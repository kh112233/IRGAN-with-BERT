  The state of the environment in the Russian Federation in 
1992 remained unsatisfactory in general. The intense pollution 
of the environment by the gaseous, liquid, and solid waste of 
production and consumption continued. The slump in production 
did not bring about a comparable reduction in pollution, because 
enterprises began economizing on environmental protection 
expenditures under these critical conditions. The state of our 
economy is still having an adverse effect on the state of our 
environment. 
  The ecological catastrophe is not a threat to our country 
alone, however. The economic activities of human beings and 
their effects on nature have increased to such proportions that 
they have turned the problem of protecting the biosphere into a 
planetary or global concern. Without any fear of exaggeration, 
we can say that the survival of the human race will depend on 
its ability to solve this problem. 
  Only a comprehensive approach to environmental problems can 
promote the more effective protection and intelligent use of 
ecosystems, the guarantee of a safe future, and the 
harmonization of man's relationship with nature. No country is 
capable of doing this alone. This can only be done through 
concerted effort--on the basis of a global partnership for the 
sake of sustainable development. Development is sustainable if 
it does not disrupt the necessary conditions--social, economic, 
and ecological--for its continuation, reproducing without 
depleting its own basis. 
  These issues were discussed at the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) from 3 to 
14 June 1992. Several documents were approved at the conference, 
including the Declaration on Environment and Development, which 
announced the fundamental principles of sustainable development. 
  These principles lie at the basis of the new Russian state 
ecological policy. 
  The principal objective of state ecological policy is the 
development of a new legal and economic mechanism to regulate 
the environmental effects of economic activity. This mechanism 
would secure the inclusion of environmental requirements as 
essential elements of the procedure for assessing economic 
decisions, comprehensive and sectorial (in terms of different 
types of resources) licenses for resource use, the 
implementation of the principle ``Let the polluter pay,'' 
penalties, and the use of natural resources and ecosystems 
without depleting them. 
  Reforms resulting from the pursuit of state ecological 
policy 
will consist in the following: 
  -- the improvement of environmental protection laws and the 
group of environmental restrictions and regulations governing 
the use of resources for their adaptation to the conditions of 
the more liberal economy and denationalized property; 
  -- a gradual move toward international standards in 
technological processes and products, creating the necessary 
conditions for Russia's inclusion in the world economy and the 
international system of environmental security; 
  -- the unification of existing territorial departmental 
systems for the observation and monitoring of natural resources 
and elements of the environment under a common set of procedural 
and organizational guidelines; 
  -- economic incentives in state tax, credit, and pricing 
policy for the conservation of resources and energy and the 
incorporation of equipment and technology meeting ecological 
requirements; 
  -- ecological appraisals and environmental impact studies of 
the results of all programs and projects related to economic and 
other activity and rigorous oversight of compliance with the 
requirements of environmental impact reports; 
  -- the creation of a market for environmental projects and 
the development of entrepreneurship in this field. 
  All of this is indisputably necessary, but it is not enough 
to prevent environmental catastrophe. New scientific research 
will be needed for a more constructive analysis of the nature 
and implications of potential adverse ecological consequences of 
economic activity and for the guarantee of ecological security. 
In addition, there is no question that the ecological situation 
can only be stabilized and improved by means of changes in the 
focus of the Russian Federation's socioeconomic development, the 
establishment of new values and moral principles, and the 
reconsideration of consumption patterns and the goals, 
priorities, and methods of human activity.

<H6>  Introduction </H6>

  The state of the environment in the Russian Federation in 
1992 was influenced considerably by general economic processes 
in the country. 
  These processes displayed extremely contradictory 
development 
and were influenced by the following factors: the collapse of 
the political and economic-administrative structures of the 
former USSR; the existence of long-term negative trends dating 
back to the time when the Russian economy was still part of the 
Union; the effects of new economic processes engendered by 
radical economic reform. 
  The collapse of the USSR diminished the actual chances of 
solving ecological problems on the interstate level and in 
Russia itself. The disruption of ties between republics had an 
adverse effect on the production of resource-conserving 
equipment, reagents for the treatment of waste liquids and 
gases, and other products needed for environmental protection. 
Difficulties arose in solving inter-republic ecological problems 
caused by the rising level of the Caspian Sea, the need to 
protect and reproduce the supply of water in coastal and 
trans-border aquifers, the transfer of pollutants through the 
atmosphere, and others. 
  The long-term negative tendencies with the most adverse 
effects on the state of the environment are the structural 
irregularities in the Russian economy, reflected in the 
excessive development of resource-intensive, frequently 
``dirty'' fields of production, the general technological 
underdevelopment of industry, agriculture, and construction, the 
high concentration of production units in some regions, and the 
underdeveloped infrastructure. 
  In the course of radical reform, Russia encountered new 
processes connected with the destabilization of the financial 
system, the insolvency of enterprises, and the soaring rate of 
inflation, which did much to cause the slump in production and 
investment activity. This, in turn, had a negative effect on 
conservation measures. 
  In 1992 the volume of industrial production in the national 
economy as a whole was 18.8 percent* below the 1991 figure, 
including decreases of 26.8 percent* in nonferrous metallurgy 
and 22.2 percent* in the chemical industry. The substantial 
reduction of output, however, did not result in a comparable 
reduction of environmental pollution. According to the Russian 
State Committee for Statistics, atmospheric emissions within the 
territory of Russia decreased by only 11 percent* in 1992, and 
the reduction in releases of polluted sewage was negligible. 
  Relative indicators of change in the volumes of products and 
services in different regions of the country and indicators of 
emissions and the dumping of pollutants per product cost unit 
are presented in figures 1-5.

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-05B>           Figure 5. Change in Dumping of </FIG>



  The reasons for this were the increased leniency in the 
oversight of technological regulations in the basic production 
units and in the operation of treatment plants, the 
deterioration of fixed assets in production, including 
resource-conserving assets, the reduction of the output and 
deterioration of the quality of chemical reagents used in the 
treatment of waste gases and liquids, and the unsatisfactory 
performance of environmental monitoring agencies. 
  The depreciation of fixed assets in industry as a whole 
exceeded 50 percent in 1992, and depreciation and the state of 
productive assets reached the critical level in several 
branches--petroleum refining, electrical power engineering, wood 
processing, and the chemical industry. This was the main reason 
why many production units in these branches became potentially 
dangerous sources of accidental environmental pollution. In 
1992, for example, the deterioration of equipment, the low 
technical standards, and the obsolescence of technological 
processes created a critical ecological situation at several 
enterprises of the pulp and paper industry, including the Bratsk 
Timber Industry Complex, the Solombalskiy Pulp and Paper 
Combine, and several other enterprises. 
  Even the meager ``remainder'' financing of environmental 
construction projects in the pre-reform years was diminished in 
1992 by the dramatic decline of investment activity throughout 
the national economy. 
  Total capital investments in environmental construction 
projects in 1992 from all funding sources were almost 20 
percent* below the 1991 figure. The volume of completed 
environmental projects was reduced dramatically. The number of 
new facilities for the decontamination of waste gases in 1992 
was almost 50 percent lower than the figure for the previous 
year. 
  Nongovernmental economic structures continued to play an 
insignificant part in the development of conservation measures, 
although the results of several interesting research and design 
projects in conservation were made available to them. There were 
no perceptible advances in the conservation, protection, and 
reproduction of natural resources in 1992. 
  To a considerable extent, this was due to the insufficient 
efforts in the past year to install a new 
economic-organizational mechanism to monitor resource use, 
particularly on the regional level. On this level, the recording 
and assessment of natural resources have not been organized 
efficiently yet, there has been virtually no progress in 
conducting a comprehensive cadastre, projects in the study and 
reproduction of resources are not being coordinated adequately, 
there are no economic controls over the use of several types of 
resources, and the main shortcoming is the lack of comprehensive 
resource management. The factors contributing to this have 
included the continuous restructuring of government 
administrative bodies, including agencies responsible for the 
management of natural resources, and the incomplete process of 
distinguishing between federal and regional ownership of natural 
resources, which has frequently resulted in the inefficient use 
of resources and the deterioration of natural complexes. 
  All of these statements are corroborated by the contents of 
the report. The purpose of the report is not a mere analysis of 
the ecological situation, however, but also the disclosure of 
the reasons for its present state and some constructive 
proposals on ways of surmounting negative tendencies. This is 
the 
purpose of the rest of this report. 
<H6>  Section 1. Environmental Quality and the State of Natural 
Resources </H6>
<H5>  1.1. Climatic Distinctions of the Year </H5>
  The global warming observed in the northern hemisphere 
reached record levels in 1990 and then decreased in the next two 
years. The average annual air temperature anomaly (in relation 
to the base period of 1951-1980) in the northern hemisphere 
dropped from 0.55 C in 1990 to 0.11 C in 1992 (Figure 
1.1.1). Meanwhile, the average monthly temperature in the 
northern hemisphere was below the norm from July to November. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-06A>           Figure 1.1.1. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>



  In the last five years (1988-1992), the average annual 
temperature for Russia as a whole and for the majority of its 
regions (Figure 1.1.2) exceeded the norm (by 1.4 C in 1990, 
the warmest year). The average annual temperature anomaly for 
the Russian Federation dropped from 1.4 C in 1990 to 
0.2 C in 1992. In 1992 air temperature was substantially 
lower in many parts of the country, especially West Siberia and 
the Northeast. The drop in the average annual temperature was 
not as dramatic in Central Asia, Siberia, the cis-Amur and 
Maritime region, and the cis-Baykal and Transbaykal region 
(Figure 1.1.3). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-07A>           Figure 1.1.2. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-08A>           Figure 1.1.3. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>



  The winter of 1992 was extraordinarily warm in general, the 
spring was also warm in most regions, air temperature in summer 
was close to the norm, and in fall it was lower than usual 
(figures 1.1.4 and 1.1.5). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-09A>           Figure 1.1.4. Average Monthly Air </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-09B>           Figure 1.1.5. Average Monthly Air </FIG>



  Atmospheric precipitation in the Russian Federation and its 
separate regions has been fairly stable in the last 100 years 
(1891-1992): Long-term deviations have been virtually absent in 
annual precipitation and winter and summer precipitation figures. 
  Humidity readings in 1992 were close to the norm in Russia, 
although they did cover a broad range. There was not a single 
case of underprecipitation in the average regional figures and 
there was only one case of excess precipitation, but the eastern 
regions (the cis-Amur and Maritime zone and the Northeast) were 
more likely to experience lighter precipitation, and rainfall 
within the European territory of Russia (ETR) was three times 
the norm. 
<H5>  [No 20, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  Winter rainfall in the cis-Amur and Maritime zone was 15-20 
percent below the norm, and the deficiency of precipitation was 
particularly acute in the Northeast, where it was equivalent to 
almost 70 percent of the norm. Precipitation in the Central and 
Central Chernozem regions, in the Urals, in the south of West 
Siberia, in the south of Krasnoyarsk Kray, in the cis-Baykal and 
Transbaykal zone, and in the south of Amur Oblast was 60-80 
percent below the norm in March, and the figure in the Volga 
lowlands was 6-30 percent, and then in April this was replaced 
by excess moisture equivalent to as much as 120-160 percent of 
the norm, followed by another decrease in May, equivalent to 
60-80 percent of the norm. Monthly atmospheric precipitation 
anomalies in the summer are illustrated in Figure 1.1.6. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-10A>           Figure 1.1.6. Monthly Atmospheric </FIG>



  The distribution of the snow cover on Russian territory in 
spring 1992 deviated substantially from the norm. Conditions 
were particularly divergent in the country's European territory: 
There was very little snowfall (30-50 percent of the norm) in 
the western and southwestern regions, and snowfall figures 
exceeded the norm by 20-60 percent in the northern, eastern, and 
southeastern regions of this territory. 
  The hydrological patterns of rivers and ice conditions were 
irregular and anomalous in 1992. 
  The ice on the Don, the upper reaches of the Volga, and most 
of the rivers in the Volga basin melted 10-20 days earlier than 
usual. The Volga reservoirs were released from the ice early. 
The beginning of the spring ice flow into rivers of the Amur 
basin was exceptionally early. The ice flow began 6-10 days late 
in the upper reaches of the Pechora, Kama, and Lena and the 
middle and lower reaches of the Ob and Irtysh. 
  The high water mark in spring on the rivers of the Don basin 
hit a record low, and the water level in the upper reaches of 
the Volga, the Oka, the rivers of the Tobol basin, and the 
Kolyma was lower than usual. The water level of the Yenisey in 
spring was higher than usual, and it was close to the norm in 
Russia's other rivers. 
  Ice appeared on the Pechora, Northern Dvina, northern 
tributaries of the Volga, and lower reaches of the Yenisey 7-16 
days earlier than usual. Floating ice was seen later than usual 
in the Don and the Volga lowlands, and ice covered the Tsimlyan, 
Saratov, and Volgograd reservoirs later than usual. 
  Ice conditions differed in the non-Arctic seas in the winter 
of 1992-93. Ice formed early on the White Sea. Ice was light in 
the Baltic and Black seas. Conditions were close to the norm in 
the Caspian and Bering seas and the Sea of Japan and lighter 
than the norm in the Sea of Okhotsk. 
  There were 195 extraordinary hydrometeorological events in 
the Russian Federation in 1992, exceeding the average for the 
last seven years. Around half were accompanied by environmental 
damage and economic losses. The temperature frequently rose 
above 30 degrees. The year was distinguished by a well-defined 
summer, light frosts in spring and fall, and snowfall and storms 
in winter. 
<H5>  1.2. Air Quality and Protection </H5>
  Total emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992 
from stationary sources within the territory of Russia amounted 
to 28.2 million* tonnes, as compared to 31.8 million* in 1991. 
The reduction of 3.6 million* tonnes was mainly due to the 
pervasive slump in industrial production, particularly in the 
extractive and resource-processing branches. The relative 
stability of the extraction and use of gas (an ecologically 
clean fuel) played a positive role under these conditions. 
  Vehicle emissions totaled 22 million tonnes and exceeded the 
1991 figure. The dynamics of emissions of pollutants into the 
atmosphere, based on statistical data, are illustrated in Figure 
1.2.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-11A>           Figure 1.2.1. Dynamics of Atmospheric </FIG>



  These data do not include atmospheric emissions produced by 
the operation of road-construction and agricultural equipment, 
air, rail, sea, and river transport, animal husbandry complexes, 
space heaters, fires in garbage dumps and waste disposal sites, 
dust from quarries and other pollution-producing sites, forest 
fires, etc. 
  Figure 1.2.2 illustrates gross emissions of harmful 
substances from stationary sources in the country's economic 
regions in 1992. The strongest anthropogenic influences have 
been recorded in the oblasts making up the Ural economic region 
and the West Siberian, East Siberian, Northern, and Central 
economic zones. An analysis of the situation indicates that air 
pollution is comparatively uniform in the central part of 
Russia, where enterprises of almost all branches of industry are 
located. The amount and nature of air pollution in the eastern 
regions are connected with the presence of large enterprises of 
the metallurgical, gas, and petrochemical branches of industry. 
Emissions from the oil and gas complex that took shape over 
recent decades in Tyumen Oblast are still the main source of 
pollution in the West Siberian economic region and account for 
almost half of all the emissions of enterprises in that region. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-11B>           Figure 1.2.2. Distribution of Gross </FIG>



  Stricter government control revealed previously unrecorded 
sources of pollution and clarified the amount of pollutants 
emitted by previously known sources. This clarification is the 
reason for the higher emission figures in several oblasts and 
republics, including Udmurtia, Khakassia, and Tomsk Oblast. 
  The largest quantities of pollutants entered the atmosphere 
from enterprises of the fuel and energy complex, the 
metallurgical industry, and the petrochemical industry. Figure 
1.2.3 illustrates the distribution of the main elements of 
pollution in the total emissions of all recorded sources. In 
addition to producing the substances listed in the figures, 
enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy are the main 
sources of copper oxide (90 percent of national emissions), 
cadmium, metallic nickel, hydrogen cyanide, naphthalene, and 
more than 80 percent of emissions containing sulfuric acid, 
fluorides, arsenic, and other substances. Enterprises of the 
chemical and petrochemical industry are the source of 99 percent 
of all carbon disulfide emissions, and 99.8 percent of the 
methyl mercaptan in the atmosphere comes from enterprises of the 
timber industry. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-12A>           Figure 1.2.3. Contribution of Various </FIG>



  The reduction of aircraft emissions has become a primary 
objective in recent years because these now represent almost 44 
percent of total emissions and have displayed a clear tendency 
toward increase. 
  Aircraft emissions exceed 80 percent of gross emissions in 
Krasnodar Kray, Voronezh and Tambov oblasts, the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic, and the Republic of Mari El. 
Emissions from air transport in Omsk, Krasnodar, Ufa, Tyumen, 
Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Volgograd, and Yekaterinburg 
amounted to 100,000-150,000 tonnes in 1991. The highest levels 
were recorded in Moscow (586,200 tonnes), St. Petersburg 
(226,600 tonnes), and Novosibirsk (206,900 tonnes). Air 
transport is responsible for 77-97 percent of the air pollution 
in resort zones like Anapa, Yessentuki, Sochi, and Kislovodsk. 
  According to observations of agencies of the Russian Federal 
Hydrometeorological and Environmental Monitoring Service, the 
1992 average concentrations of one or several pollutants 
exceeded the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] in the air of 
171 cities and was equivalent to 5 times the MAC in 55 cities. 
In 83 cities single incidents of concentrations of certain 
pollutants exceeded public health standards by 10 times, and in 
nine cities the concentration was 50 times the norm. Bratsk, 
Berezniki, Kemerovo, Magnitogorsk, Moscow, Novokuznetsk, Omsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, and other cities are on the list of cities 
with the heaviest air pollution every year. Pollution exceeding 
the maximum and average daily MAC was recorded in 337 cities in 
1992. High levels of air pollution are regularly recorded in the 
following cities: 
  Arkhangelsk, Amursk, Bratsk, Baykalsk, Novodvinsk, and 
Ust-Ilimsk--by methyl mercaptan; 
  Gubakha--by hydrogen sulfide; 
  Volsk--by acetaldehyde; 
  Magnitogorsk--by styrene; 
  Nizhniy Tagil, Chelyabinsk, and Yekaterinburg--by benzpyrene 
(BP); 
  Usolye-Sibirskoye--by mercury; 
  Rudnaya Pristan--by lead; 
  Norilsk--by sulfur dioxide; 
  Omsk--by ethylbenzene; 
  Berezniki, Baykalsk, Balakovo, and Kemerovo--by carbon 
disulfide; 
  Khabarovsk--by formaldehyde; 
  Gubakha and Moscow--by phenol; 
  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinskiy, and 
Korsakov--by soot; 
  Moscow--by carbon monoxide. 
  Air quality observations in 1988-1992 have recorded the 
reduction of average concentrations of suspended matter, soluble 
sulfates, ammonium, benzpyrene, soot, hydrogen sulfide, and 
formaldehyde as a result of cuts in production and the closure 
of enterprises. Meanwhile, there have been higher average 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon 
disulfide, phenol, and hydrogen fluoride because of the 
irregular operations of enterprises. Higher concentrations of 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and formaldehyde have also 
been recorded on highways in big cities and adjacent 
territories. The highest air pollution index (API exceeding 14) 
in 1992 was recorded in the following 44 cities: Abakan, 
Angarsk, Arkhangelsk, Achinsk, Berezniki, Bratsk, Vladivostok, 
Volzhskiy, Groznyy, Gubakha, Yekaterinburg, Zima, Irkutsk, 
Kamensk-Uralskiy, Kemerovo, Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk, Kurgan, 
Lipetsk, Magadan, Magnitogorsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Novodvinsk, Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, Novocherkassk, Omsk, 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Rostov-on-Don, Saratov, Selenginsk, 
Stavropol, Taganrog, Tolyatti, Ulan-Ude, Ulyanovsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, Khabarovsk, Chelyabinsk, Cherepovets, Chita, 
Shelekhov, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. 
<H5>  Air Pollution Readings in Russia </H5>
  The atmospheric precipitate of chemical compounds in Russia 
can be judged from the observations of stations monitoring the 
pollution of the snow cover. The density of the observation 
network in the ETR and the Urals is one station for every 8,000 
square kilometers, and in the Asian territory of Russia (ATR) it 
is one station for every 30,000 square kilometers. The volume 
and intensity of sulfur and nitrogen precipitate in the country 
in 1992 are presented in Table 1.2.1.

  No significant differences between levels of sulfur and 
nitrogen precipitate in 1992 and the previous year were recorded. 
  The acid content of winter rainfall in the Russian 
Federation 
was negligible. The pH value of the snow pack in most of this 
territory, including urbanized and agricultural regions, ranged 
from 5.5 to 5.7. A higher acid number (pH 4.5-5.5) was recorded 
in winter rains on the Kola peninsula, in the north of the ETR, 
on the eastern slopes of the Urals, and in the west of Taymyr 
and the environs of Lake Baykal and Novosibirsk. 
  The average annual intensity of metal precipitate found in 
snow samples is listed in Table 1.2.2. An analysis of the 
samples indicated that 85-95 percent of all the detected metals 
were in aerosol form and the rest was liquid filtrate. Excessive 
concentrations of metals in precipitation were recorded in areas 
measuring hundreds of square kilometers (and more rarely in 
thousands). Anomalous areas of metal concentration (tens of 
thousands of square kilometers) were located in the large 
industrial centers of the Urals, the central part of the ETR, 
and the Kuzbass.

  Concentrations of cadmium, lead, and selenium were twice as 
high near highways in most cities than in residential 
neighborhoods, regardless of the distinctive features of 
industrial production in these cities. 
<H5>  Background Air Pollution </H5>
  The comprehensive background monitoring network now consists 
of six stations located in biosphere preserves: Central-Forest, 
Oka-Terrace, Voronezh, Astrakhan, and Caucasus. 
  Readings over several years indicate air pollution levels in 
the ETR that are 3-10 times as high as in East Siberia. 
Furthermore, in the case of contaminants undergoing 
transformation in the air (sulfur dioxide and benzpyrene), 
average concentrations generally decrease as the pollutants are 
carried to the south, while average concentrations of dust and 
sulfates generally increase, which is particularly apparent from 
the rise in maximum figures. 
  In 1991 the content of heavy metals in the air in most of 
the 
background territories did not change, and the content of sulfur 
and nitrogen compounds also remained at the 1990 levels. 
Background concentrations of DDT and HCCH pesticides continued 
to decrease, particularly in the south of Russia. BP levels 
remained high in the western regions of the ETR: Up to 70 
percent of the samples taken in the cold season exceeded the 
average daily MAC. The content of pollutants in precipitation in 
the background territories was monitored at 15 stations working 
on regional and international programs. 
  The content of heavy metals in precipitation was also 
approximately the same as it had been the previous year. Data on 
heavy metal precipitate in 1992 in milligrams per square 
kilometer in the year are presented in Table 1.2.3.

  Changes in the lead content of precipitation during the year 
usually correspond to its content in the air (more in winter 
than in the warm season). 
  The overall mineral content of precipitation ranged from 5 
to 
25 mg/liter. The acid type of precipitation was recorded at most 
of the stations in the ETR. Fluctuations in pH values over many 
years display no distinct tendencies and are due to the natural 
variability of processes. There was more acid rain in winter 
than in summer at 64 percent of the stations, because fuel use 
patterns change in winter, tending toward the use of more liquid 
and solid types of fuel with acid-forming components--sulfur and 
nitrogen. Acid rains with a pH value of 3.5 were recorded in 
several background regions on the Valday ridge and in the 
Oka-Terrace biosphere preserve. Precipitation is more alkaline 
as it moves eastward. 
<H5>  The Earth's Ozone Layer </H5>
  Statistical processing of the data of observations in the 
network of ground stations for the measurement of the total 
ozone content (TOC) with Dobson instruments, the M-83/124, and 
the TOMS satellite system indicated a lower TOC both in winter 
and in the spring and summer months in the northern and southern 
hemispheres, with the exception of the tropics. 
  According to satellite observations, the reduction of TOC at 
an altitude of 40 kilometers, which is most vulnerable to the 
influence of the chlorine cycle, was no more than 5 percent 
during the decade, which is approximately half as high as the 
prediction based on simulation models. 
  In general, the winter of 1991-92 was one of the most 
anomalous in the whole period of ozonometric observations. The 
greatest average monthly deviations of TOC were 20 percent in 
January, 15 percent in February, and 20 percent in March. A 
lower TOC began to be recorded over North Asia and Canada in 
February 1992, and the TOC in virtually the whole 45-70 north 
latitude zone was 10-20 percent below the norm in February and 
March. 
  The period from April through August 1992 was also marked by 
a lower TOC figure in virtually all of the territory of the 
former USSR. The greatest deviations from average monthly 
figures (up to 15 percent in April and up to 10 percent in 
May-July) were recorded over the northern ETR, East Siberia, and 
Yakutia. The TOC in August was close to climatic norms. 
  Fall was marked by a somewhat lower TOC, but within the 
range 
of natural variations. 
  Although a lower ozone content over Antarctica was recorded 
last year, this is the fourth year in a row (1989-1992) that the 
``ozone hole'' was as deep and as wide as it was in 1987. The 
absence of quasi-biennial cyclical changes was apparently due to 
the prevailing influence of chemical destruction in comparison 
with dynamic fluctuations. The maximum area with a TOC below 200 
Dobson units was recorded on 27 September 1992 and is estimated 
at 22.6 million square kilometers. 
<H5>  1.3. Water Resources and Their Quality, Protection, and Use </H5>
<H5>  Surface Water </H5>
  The combined flow of all of the rivers in Russia in 1992 was 
5 percent above the average. Regional changes in the flow are 
illustrated in Figure 1.3.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-17A>           Figure 1.3.1. Regional Changes in </FIG>



  There was less water in the rivers than in 1991 in almost 
all 
parts of the ETR, with the exception of the north. This tendency 
was apparently connected with the onset of a drought in vast 
areas of the ETR, which could complicate environmental 
conditions and compound the water shortage in the central and 
southern regions. 
  The water level in the Volga River in 1992 was lower than in 
1991 and was almost equivalent to the average. The levels of the 
Don, Dnieper, Ob, and Angara rivers were below the norm. 
  Particularly high water levels were recorded in the rivers 
of 
Karelia and the Kola peninsula (5-20 percent above the norm) and 
rivers in East Siberia (5-11 percent above the norm). The level 
was close to the norm or 1-15 percent below in the rivers of the 
Central Chernozem, North Caucasus, Ural, Volga, and Far Eastern 
economic regions. 
  The reduced flow in the large Russian rivers used 
extensively 
in economic operations now ranges from 10 percent below the norm 
for the Volga River to 15-40 percent for the Don, Kuban, Terek, 
and other rivers. 
  The degradation of small Russian rivers was compounded by 
the 
erosion in drainage areas. In 1992 these processes were most 
intense in the Central, Volga-Vyatka, cis-Volga, West Siberian, 
and East Siberian regions. 
  The amounts of river water used for the regulation of 
supplies in reservoirs were significant: 3.96 km[.sup]3[/] 
removed from the Don River and 0.6 km[.sup]3[/] from the 
Kuban River for accumulation in the Tsimlyanskoye Reservoir, 1.6 
km[.sup]3[/] from the Yenisey River for the replenishment of 
supplies in the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir, and around 0.9 
km[.sup]3[/] from the Volga for the replenishment of water 
reserves in all reservoirs. 
<H5>  Water Use and the Dumping of Polluted Sewage </H5>
  According to state water use records, the total amount of 
water taken out of natural bodies of water in 1992 was 6.3* 
km[.sup]3[/] below the 1991 figure and amounted to 110.7* 
km[.sup]3[/]. The reasons were the slump in production and 
the reduced output of electrical power. The total included 94.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water and 5.2* km[.sup]3[/] of sea 
water, and 8.5* km[.sup]3[/] were used for the inter-basin 
and territorial redistribution of supplies. The amount used for 
national economic needs was 90* km[.sup]3[/], including 48.5* 
km[.sup]3[/] for industrial needs, 15.4* km[.sup]3[/] for 
irrigation, 14.7* km[.sup]3[/] for drinking and household 
needs, 4* km[.sup]3[/] for agriculture, and 7.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] for other needs. 
  Changes in water use in 1992 in different regions of the 
Russian Federation in relation to 1991 figures are illustrated 
in Figure 1.3.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-17B>           Figure 1.3.2. Changes in Water Use in </FIG>



  In industry, 22 percent* of all of the water used came from 
natural bodies of water, and 78 percent* was recycled (76 
percent* in 1991). The dynamics of water use are presented in 
Figure 1.3.3, and the data on recycled water use are presented 
in Figure 1.3.4.

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-18B>           Figure 1.3.4. Dynamics of Water </FIG>



  Losses of water in transport amounted to 8.4* km[.sup]3[/]. 
  The amount of sewage released into bodies of water in 1992 
was 2.6* km[.sup]3[/] less than in 1991 and totaled 70.6* 
km[.sup]3[/], with 38 percent (27.1* km[.sup]3[/]) falling 
into the category of polluted sewage (untreated or partially 
decontaminated). 
<H5>  [No 21, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  Most of the polluted sewage was dumped by enterprises in 
industry (41.7 percent*) and by public utilities (44.3 
percent*). Polluted sewage dumping in different regions of the 
country and changes in the amounts in 1992 in relation to 1991 
figures are presented in figures 1.3.5 and 1.3.6, and the 
distribution of polluted sewage among the basins of the main 
Russian rivers is illustrated in Figure 1.3.7. The amount of 
polluted sewage dumped in the last six years (in cubic 
kilometers) was 16.7* in 1987, 23.3* in 1988, 27.1* in 1989, 
27.8* in 1990, 28.0* in 1991, and 27.1* in 1992. In the last 
four years the amount of polluted sewage has remained virtually 
the same. The total amount of adequately treated sewage in 1992 
was 2.8* km[.sup]3[/], or 9 percent* of all the sewage 
requiring treatment (30* km[.sup]3[/]). This occurred because 
treatment plants are overloaded and inefficient.

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-20A>           Figure 1.3.7. Polluted Sewage Dumped </FIG>



  The amount of water in sewer drains was 2.2* km[.sup]3[/] 
greater than in 1991. 
  The following were dumped into bodies of water along with 
sewage in 1992 (in thousands of tonnes): 
  petroleum products--39.4* 
  suspended matter--1,089.9* 
  common phosphorus--59.8* 
  ammonium nitrogen--187.0* 
  phenols--0.2* 
  synthetic surfactants--8.9* 
  copper compounds--0.9* 
  ferrous compounds--51.2* 
  zinc compounds--1.6* 
  The amount of petroleum products dumped with sewage was 
considerably larger than in 1991. 
<H5>  Surface Water Pollution </H5>
  The quality of water in the majority of bodies of water does 
not meet standard requirements. Observations of surface water 
quality over many years have revealed a tendency toward an 
increase in the number of sites with high pollution levels (over 
10 times the MAC) and extremely high levels (over 100 times the 
MAC). 
  The state of sources of water (surface and subterranean) and 
centralized water supply systems cannot guarantee the required 
quality of drinking water, and in some regions (the Volga 
lowlands, the southern Urals, the Kuzbass, and some northern 
territories) this is jeopardizing human health. 
  Sanitary and epidemiological oversight agencies regularly 
announce high levels of surface water pollution. Their data on 
the sanitary condition of surface water in the locations of 
drinking water supplies are presented in Table 1.3.1. Around a 
third of all the pollutants enter sources of water in rainfall 
and surface runoff from the territories of populated communities 
with unsatisfactory sanitation and of agricultural facilities 
and fields, causing the seasonal deterioration of the quality of 
drinking water that is recorded each year in big cities, 
including Moscow, during the spring rains. This results in the 
excessive chlorination of drinking water, and this is also 
dangerous to human health because of the formation of 
organochlorine compounds.

  The quality of the public supply of drinking water in 1992 
was virtually the same as in 1991: 22.1 percent of the analyzed 
samples did not meet the sanitary-chemical requirements of 
hygienic standards, and 12.3 percent did not satisfy 
microbiological requirements. 
  The drinking water of around a third of the population comes 
from decentralized sources. An analysis of the water in these 
sources indicated that 28 percent of the samples did not satisfy 
the sanitary-chemical requirements and 29.4 percent did not 
satisfy the bacteriological requirements of hygienic standards. 
In general, the drinking water of around 50 percent of the 
population of the Russian Federation still does not satisfy 
certain quality indicators. The situation is particularly 
serious in Arkhangelsk, Kursk, Tomsk, Yaroslavl, Kaluga, and 
Kaliningrad oblasts, Maritime Kray, Kalmykia, Dagestan, and 
Karachay-Cherkessia. 
  It is disturbing that 21.7 percent of the public utilities 
and 20.1 percent of the departmental water systems had to pipe 
water to the public in 1992 without decontaminating it because 
of the lack of special installations. This creates favorable 
conditions for epidemics. 
  From 31 to 64 percent of the sources of drinking water in 
Kaluga, Smolensk, Kursk, Saratov, Kaliningrad, and Chita oblasts 
have no sanitary protective zones. 
  The results of analyses of samples of drinking water from 
public water supplies are presented in Table 1.3.2.

  The unsatisfactory sanitary and chemical state of water 
supply lines and networks leads to the secondary pollution of 
drinking water on its way to the consumer, primarily as a result 
of accidents, which have caused outbreaks of infectious 
diseases. The number of these diseases increased from 9 in 1991 
to 16 in 1992, and the total number of victims was 2,457. Cases 
of infection were recorded in Uglich in Yaroslavl Oblast, in 
Pinega in Arkhangelsk Oblast, in Konakovo in Tver Oblast, and in 
Kiselevsk in Kemerovo Oblast. 
  The state of water supply lines in public recreation areas 
is 
unsatisfactory (Table 1.3.3).

  The details of water use, sewage dumping, and surface water 
quality in the basins of the main rivers and lakes in Russia are 
presented below. 
  The Neva River basin: The provision of industry, 
agriculture, and the population with water is no problem from 
the standpoint of quantity--this requires no more than 1 percent 
of the average annual flow. 
  Releases of polluted sewage, however, have increased each 
year. In 1992, 710,000 tonnes of pollutants were dumped in 
bodies of water in the Neva basin. None of the sewage in this 
basin has been treated adequately. 
  In 1992, 1.5* km[.sup]3[/] of industrial, agricultural, 
and municipal sewage, including 0.35* km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage, were dumped in Lake Ladoga. In 
addition to the serious pollution in coastal regions, there is 
the severe pollution of Volkhov Cove and the year-round shipping 
lanes in the northern part of the lake. As a result of biogenic 
substances from agricultural lands and facilities, which enter 
the lake mainly in surface runoff, there are signs of 
eutrophication in many parts of the lake. 
  The Dnieper River basin: The upper reaches of the 
river are located in Russia. The amount of fresh water removed 
from this basin in 1992 was 1.07* km[.sup]3[/], and the 
amount used was 1.03 km[.sup]3[/]. 
  The region is distinguished by a high recycling rate--95 
percent* of the water supply. The amount of sewage dumped in the 
river is 0.6* km[.sup]3[/], including 0.3* km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage. Waste treatment plants can handle 0.5 
km[.sup]3[/], exceeding the amount requiring treatment. The 
quality rating of the water in the Dnieper and Desna rivers in 
Russia ranges from ``clean'' to ``polluted.'' 
  The Don River basin: The amount taken out of the 
river for use is 9.8* km[.sup]3[/] (around 42 percent of the 
average annual flow). Water shortages in the region can be acute 
because up to 50 percent of the water is used during the dry 
season (June-September). 
  In the upper reaches of the river, the section near Donskoy 
is the most highly polluted with nitrogen compounds (up to 10 
times the MAC). The quality of water in the Don lowlands has 
been stabilized, although it is still distinguished by an 
excessive average annual content of nitrites and petroleum 
products (up to six times the MAC) and copper compounds (up to 
eight times the MAC). 
  The water in the Russian part of the Northern Donets River 
is 
rated ``polluted.'' The content of petroleum products, phenols, 
zinc and copper compounds, and other pollutants can be as high 
as 3.5-7 times the MAC in the small rivers of the Don River 
basin. 
  The Kuban River basin: This is one of the regions 
with limited water resources. The amount used each year exceeds 
10* km[.sup]3[/], or 74 percent of the average annual flow. 
More than 1* km[.sup]3[/] is lost during transport. 
  In 1992, 1.8* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, containing 
677,000 tonnes of pollutants, was dumped in the Kuban River 
basin. The result is a high level of pollution in several of its 
tributaries and sections of the river near Nevinnomyssk and 
Armavir. 
  There is a higher content of copper and ferrous compounds in 
the upper reaches of tributaries of the Kuban, particularly the 
Uryup River, due to the sewage of ore-dressing combines. An 
excessive nitrite content (up to five times the MAC) was 
recorded in the Kuban River from Karachayevsk to the Krasnodar 
Reservoir. The water in the Krasnodar Reservoir is rated 
``moderately polluted.'' Organic chlorine and phosphorus 
pesticides and 2,4-D-aminosalicylate have been found in this 
water. Pipeline accidents raised the content of petroleum 
products up to 27 times the MAC in the Kuban River near Temryuk. 
  Meanwhile, the content of organic chlorine and phosphorous 
pesticides in the Kuban River delta decreased because of the 
reduced use of these pesticides in agricultural areas of the 
river lowlands in 1992. 
  The Volga River basin: In 1992, 37.3* 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water was removed from bodies of water 
here, representing 34 percent* of all the water collected in 
Russia and 14 percent of the annual flow in the river basin. The 
amount of sewage dumped in surface bodies of water here was 22* 
km[.sup]3[/], including 10.7* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted 
sewage. The amount of polluted sewage released in the Volga 
basin represented 39 percent* of all the polluted sewage in 
Russia. 
  The water in the Volga series of reservoirs has high 
concentrations of phenol (2-5 times the MAC), petroleum products 
(3-10 times the MAC), and copper compounds (5-6 times the MAC). 
Nitrogen compounds, methanol, cyanide, and zinc were found in 
the water below Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  The average annual content of ammonium and nitrite nitrogen 
in the Oka River was 2-9 times the MAC, and the content of 
petroleum products was 4-14 times the MAC. The level of water 
pollution by ammonium nitrogen has been stabilized at 6-12 times 
the MAC in the Moscow and Pakhra rivers. Water quality displayed 
serious deterioration in the Klyazma River (near Kovrov) in 
1992, with the average annual content of petroleum products 
recorded at 38 times the MAC within the city limits and 100 
times the MAC downstream from the city. 
  The level of pollution by organochlorine pesticides has been 
too high for several years in the Chapayevka River (in 
Chapayevsk). The water in the Chusovaya River (in Pervouralsk) 
always has excessive levels of copper compounds (57-101 times 
the MAC), zinc (more than 10 times the MAC), and chromium (up to 
20 times the MAC). 
  The Ural River basin: Given the present level of 
water consumption, this is one of the regions with a water 
shortage. Water intake in the basin within Russian territory in 
1992 was 2.9* km[.sup]3[/], representing 35 percent of the 
average flow and equivalent to all of the river flow in dry 
years. Around 2.2* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, including 0.2* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, was dumped in surface bodies 
of water in the basin during the year. There was a particularly 
perceptible increase in the amount of ferrous and nitrogen 
compounds dumped in this basin. Excessive concentrations of 
ammonium and nitrite nitrogen, sulfates, chlorides, ferrous 
compounds, and petroleum products have been recorded in the 
water of the Ural River. The most heavily polluted sections of 
the river are near Orsk and Orenburg. The water downstream from 
the sewage drain of the Orsk-Khalilovsk Metallurgical Combine is 
always distinguished by excessive concentrations of petroleum 
products (up to 33 times the MAC) and sporadic high readings of 
phenol (up to 200 times the MAC). The Ilek River, a tributary of 
the Ural, is polluted by hexavalent chromium as a result of 
underground seepage from the storage tanks of plants in 
Aktyubinsk (Kazakhstan). 
  The Terek River basin: Water conditions are 
critical here. Water intake in 1992 amounted to 6.5* 
km[.sup]3[/], or 59.6 percent* of the average annual flow. 
Around 2* km[.sup]3[/] are lost in irrigation supply lines. 
Around 0.6* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, including 0.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, is dumped into surface 
bodies of water in the basin. The Terek River and its 
tributaries are polluted by ferrous compounds, zinc, ammonium 
nitrogen, and petroleum products, and in terms of degrees of 
pollution the water is rated ``moderately polluted'' and 
``polluted.'' 
  The Pechora River basin: Water intake in 1992 was 
0.57* km[.sup]3[/], or 0.3 percent of the average annual flow. 
  The amount of sewage released into bodies of water in the 
basin in 1992 was 0.48* km[.sup]3[/], including 0.05* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage. The main sources of 
pollution in the rivers of this basin are enterprises of the 
oil, gas, and coal industries and geological prospecting 
organizations. 
  Excessive concentrations of phenol, petroleum products, and 
copper compounds have been recorded all along the river, with 
the highest content, of up to 8-20 times the MAC, near Pechora 
and Vuktyl. 
  The Northern Dvina River basin: Water intake in 
1992 was 1.2* km[.sup]3[/], 81 percent* of which was used for 
industrial purposes. Around 1.0* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, 
including 0.8* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, containing 
1.5 million tonnes of pollutants, was released into the basin. 
  Petroleum products, copper, nitrogen compounds, and certain 
substances characteristic of the sewage of the pulp and paper 
industry--lignosulfanates, formaldehyde, and methanol--are still 
the most prevalent pollutants in the water of the Northern Dvina 
River. 
  Chronically high levels of water pollution are 
characteristic 
of the small rivers of the Kola peninsula in the operational 
zone of the Norilskiy Nikel state concern. The highest 
concentrations of nickel compounds (38-43 times the MAC) have 
been recorded here. The most highly polluted body of water is 
still the Nyuduay River, where critical levels of several copper 
and nickel compounds were found in 1992. 
  The Ob River basin: This river is subject to 
strong anthropogenic influences from its source to its estuary. 
Around 10.5* km[.sup]3[/] of water were taken out of the Ob 
River basin in 1992 for use. Around 7.1* km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage was dumped in surface bodies of water in the basin. Of 
the total amount, 3.8* km[.sup]3[/] of the sewage required 
treatment, 3.4* km[.sup]3[/] was treated, but only 25 percent 
met standard requirements after treatment. 
  The pollution of the water by phenols and petroleum products 
has been recorded in all sections of the Ob River. The water in 
all sections is rated ``polluted,'' and in some sections it is 
categorized as ``contaminated'' (from Surgut to Polnovat) and 
``highly contaminated'' (in Kolpashevo and Aleksandrovskoye). 
  The average annual concentration of petroleum products in 
some sections of the Irtysh River has risen as high as 56-114 
times the MAC. The water in the Irtysh River near Tobolsk and 
the Tura River near Tyumen is rated ``highly contaminated,'' and 
the water in the Tobol River near Tobolsk is categorized as 
``extremely contaminated.'' 
  The tributaries of the Tobol River are severely polluted. 
The 
highest level of contamination is in the Iset River near 
Yekaterinburg and Aramil. The Miass River (Chelyabinsk) has a 
``highly contaminated'' rating, and the Tura River (Verkhoturye 
and Turinsk) and Salda River, where the average annual content 
of copper compounds reaches 264 times the MAC, are rated 
``extremely contaminated.'' The water in the Nitsa, Neyva, 
Pyshma, Kunara, and Lyalya rivers and the section of the Tagil 
River near Verkhniy Tagil and Nizhniy Tagil is categorized as 
``contaminated'' and ``extremely contaminated.'' 
  The Yenisey River basin: The amount of water taken 
out of water sources in the Yenisey basin for economic and 
household use in 1992 was 0.6* km[.sup]3[/] less than in 1991 
and totaled 4.97* km[.sup]3[/]. Around 3.9* km[.sup]3[/] 
of sewage was dumped into surface bodies of water in the basin, 
2.34* km[.sup]3[/] required treatment, 1.33* km[.sup]3[/] 
underwent decontamination treatment, and only 1.1 percent* was 
treated adequately. Around 62 percent of all the polluted sewage 
entering the Yenisey River basin comes from the Angara River 
basin. Waste treatment plants in this region are capable of 
handling 1.4 km[.sup]3[/], but only 0.35 percent of them are 
operating efficiently. 
  The most prevalent substances polluting the water in the 
basin are petroleum products, phenols, copper compounds, zinc, 
and others. Average annual concentrations of petroleum products 
reached 13-15 times the MAC in the upper and middle reaches of 
the Yenisey, and hydrocarbons, resins, and asphaltenes were 
found in the water near Kyzyl. 
  Water pollution is more intense downstream. Whereas the 
water 
in the upper reaches of the Yenisey is rated ``contaminated,'' 
certain sections in the lowlands are categorized as ``highly 
contaminated.'' 
  Extremely high levels of methyl mercaptan and hydrogen 
sulfide (hundreds of times the MAC) and high levels of lignin, 
cyanide, rhodanine, and petroleum products have been more common 
in the Angara River in recent years. The pollution rating of the 
water in the Angara River and its tributaries ranges from 
``polluted'' to ``highly contaminated.'' 
  The Lake Baykal basin: Sewage releases in 1992 
were the same as in 1991 and amounted to 0.23* km[.sup]3[/]. 
Although the capacity of sewage treatment plants exceeds the 
quantity of polluted sewage requiring treatment, only 11 
percent* of the treated sewage satisfies standard requirements. 
  The main sources of pollution in the lake are still the 
Selenginsk TsKK [Pulp and Cardboard Combine] and Baykalsk TsBK 
[pulp and paper combine]. Almost 70 percent of their sewage 
consists of decomposition-resistant organic substances. 
  The pollutants released into the lake with the sewage of the 
Baykalsk TsBK in 1992 surpassed all recorded indicators in 1991, 
including a 37-percent increase in phenols, an increase of 19 
percent in chlorides, and an increase of 5 percent in 
oxidation-resistant organic substances. 
  The sewage dumped in the Lake Baykal basin in 1992 included 
26,000* tonnes of sulfates, 18,000* tonnes of chlorides, 1,000* 
tonnes of nitrates, 350* tonnes of synthetic surfactants, 170* 
tonnes of common phosphorus, around 1* tonne of phenol, and 
large quantities of other pollutants. 
  Concentrations of petroleum products and phenols were higher 
in all of the large tributaries of Lake Baykal in 1992, and this 
increased the content of these substances in the lake. The 
largest increases in petroleum products and sulfates were 
recorded in the southern part of the lake. 
  The Lena River basin: In 1992, just as in previous 
years, the amount of water used for economic purposes 
represented only a negligible part of available resources and 
amounted to 0.39* km[.sup]3[/], which was 2 percent* below 
the 1991 figure. Around 0.25* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage was 
released into surface bodies of water in the basin. Around 0.18* 
km[.sup]3[/] of the sewage required treatment, and 26 
percent* satisfied standard requirements after treatment. 
  Most of the rivers in the Lena River basin are categorized 
as 
``moderately polluted'' bodies of water, with an average annual 
pollutant content of no more than 5-10 times the MAC. 
  The highest phenol content (up to 17 times the MAC) in the 
Lena River is usually recorded during spring floods and is due 
to anthropogenic influences and to natural processes. The 
readings of up to 12-16 times the MAC for copper compounds are 
due to the solubility of the minerals lining the river bed and 
the partial thawing of permafrost. 
  The Kolyma River basin: The main source of the 
suspended matter, petroleum products, phenols, and ammonium 
nitrogen in the water of the Kolyma River and its tributaries is 
the sewage of Glavalmazzoloto enterprises and public utilities. 
  The highest levels of pollution in the Kolyma River and the 
other rivers of this basin are recorded during the spring 
floods, when the maximum concentration of suspended matter rises 
as high as 123-414 mg/l, the level of copper compounds is 70 
times the MAC, and the level of ammonium nitrogen is 9 times the 
MAC. 
  The Amur River basin: In spite of the relatively 
small quantities of water removed from the Amur River for 
economic and household use (1.34* km[.sup]3[/], or 0.03 
percent* of the average monthly flow), 0.88* km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage was dumped into this basin in 1992. Around 0.65* 
km[.sup]3[/] required treatment, and only 5 percent* 
satisfied standard requirements after treatment. 
  The quality rating of the water in the Amur River changes 
from ``moderately polluted'' to ``highly contaminated'' as the 
water flow downstream. The highest levels of pollution are near 
the rural community of Bogorodskoye and the city of Nikolayevsk, 
where maximum concentrations of copper compounds reach 80 times 
the MAC, the zinc content is 56 times the MAC, and the phenol 
content is 90 times the MAC. The average level of copper 
compounds in the Kholdomi and Silinka rivers reached 21-57 times 
the MAC and the zinc content reached 21-71 times the MAC, with 
respective maximums of 250 and 120 times the MAC. 
  The Ussuri River has a ``moderately polluted'' rating, and 
sections of its tributaries are rated ``contaminated'' or 
``highly contaminated.'' 
  Phenols are the most common pollutant in the rivers of the 
Kamchatka peninsula. The content of these reaches 3-7 
times the MAC. Maximum concentrations of phenol were as high as 
20-26 times the MAC in some of these rivers during the spring 
floods of 1992. Enterprises of the woodworking industry, timber 
rafting, and the swamp waters of the West Kamchatka Plain are 
the main sources of phenols. 
  The content of other pollutants is negligible and generally 
stays within the limits of the MAC. Most of the bodies of water 
on the peninsula have a ``clean'' rating, and only a few are 
rated ``moderately polluted.'' 
  Most of the rivers of Sakhalin Island have a 
``moderately contaminated'' rating, and the average annual 
content of pollutants in the water does not exceed 4-5 times the 
MAC. The Okhinka River (in Okha) is rated ``highly 
contaminated,'' with an average annual petroleum product content 
of 26 times the MAC and a maximum content of 49 times the MAC. 
<H5>  The Seas </H5>
  All of the inland and land-locked seas in Russia are exposed 
to intense anthropogenic influences in their water and in their 
catchment basins. 
  Water pollution levels are monitored in all of the inland 
and 
land-locked seas. The degree of pollution is measured by a 
7-point scale of water quality, ranging from ``very clean'' to 
``extremely contaminated.'' 
  Quantities of sewage released into the seas of the Russian 
Federation in 1992 are presented in Table 1.3.4.

  Processes of attrition were characteristic of coastal areas, 
and more than 60 percent of the coastline is suffering from 
destruction, erosion, and submersion. This is inflicting 
considerable damage on the national economy and is another 
source of marine pollution. 
  The Azov Sea is the most shallow and ecologically 
vulnerable of the inland seas. The development of its ecosystem 
depends on the water level of the rivers flowing into it and on 
water exchange with the Black Sea. The Azov Sea is distinguished 
by intensive shipping, a high concentration of industry, and 
high population density on the coastal strip and throughout the 
territory of its basin. 
  Most of the pollutants in the sea are carried by the runoff 
of the Don and Kuban rivers and the sewage of enterprises in 
industry, including the fish industry, public utilities, 
construction, and agriculture. 
  The level of pollution in the coastal regions of the eastern 
part of the sea remained stable from 1987 to 1991, but higher 
concentrations of pollutants were recorded in 1992, resulting in 
the deterioration of water quality in all of the monitored 
regions. Average levels of twice the MAC and maximum levels of 
5-6 times the MAC of dissolved mercury were found, just as they 
had been in 1991, on the surface of Taganrog Bay and in the Don 
River estuary. Severe mercury pollution was also recorded in 
Temryuk Bay (up to three times the MAC). Hydrometeorological 
conditions were the reason for two cases of oxygen deficiency at 
the bottom of Temryuk Bay on the shore of the Kuban River. The 
reduction of the oxygen content on the shoreline of the Kuban 
River and in its channel was measured at 6-7 percent in 1992. 
  Black Sea: The coastal waters of Krasnodar Kray 
were rated ``moderately polluted.'' The main pollutants in this 
region were petroleum hydrocarbons. The level of these had 
reached nine times the MAC in the ports of Tuapse and 
Novorossiysk in 1991. Accidents on maritime vessels were the 
main cause of this kind of pollution. 
  Caspian Sea: The water level and ecological state 
of the largest inland drainage basin depend on surface runoff, 
mainly from the Volga River, evaporation, and economic 
activities in the water and the catchment basin. The water level 
has been rising recently. In 1992 the average level was 27.04 
meters (as of 1 January 1993), displaying an average rise of 15 
centimeters. 
  A steady tendency toward higher levels of pollution in the 
Russian parts of the North Caspian was recorded from 1986 to 
1992. The rate of pollution stabilized in 1992. We can expect 
the rising water level to increase the pollution in the Volga 
River delta. The level of pollution is rising because the 
accumulated sediment in parts of the delta is releasing more 
pollutants. The water in the western part of the North Caspian 
is categorized as ``contaminated,'' and the water in other 
regions has a ``polluted'' rating, and a steady increase in 
pollution has been recorded there. 
  The improvement of ecological conditions in the North 
Caspian 
will require a broad-scale program for more efficient water use 
in the Volga River basin, which is the main source of the 
pollution. A tendency toward lower levels of pollution and the 
subsequent stabilization of this level were recorded in the 
North Caspian from 1989 to 1992, and the water there has been 
categorized as ``polluted'' for the last three years. 
  Baltic Sea: The most highly polluted regions are 
the Neva Gulf and Vyborg Cove, where the water is rated ``highly 
contaminated'' and ``contaminated.'' 
  In 1992 the average content of phenol rose to 4-7 times the 
MAC in all parts of the sea. In the Neva Gulf the concentration 
of copper reached 19 times the MAC and manganese and lead levels 
exceeded the MAC. 
  There was a tendency toward increased water pollution in 
Kursk Gulf and the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. 
  Barents Sea: The open expanses and coastal zones 
of the sea are rated ``clean'' or ``very clean,'' with the 
exception of the Kola Inlet. There is always a thin layer of 
petroleum products on the surface of the water in the regions of 
intense shipping. The water in the White Sea is still 
basically clean. 
  Arctic seas: The vulnerability of marine 
ecosystems in the Arctic basin is due to the inadequate ability 
of the cold water to cleanse itself of pollutants carried by 
river discharge. The main sources of pollution here are the Ob, 
Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma rivers. Most of the pollutants 
accumulate in the river estuaries. Pollutants are also carried 
along the periphery of the whole Arctic basin toward Alaska by 
circumpolar currents. 
  The sources of pollution are enterprises of nonferrous 
metallurgy, electrical power engineering, and public utilities. 
In addition, large quantities of radioactive substances have 
been submerged in the Barents and Kara seas. 
  The combined activity of the liquid radioactive waste (LRW) 
dumped in the northern seas is 24.4 kc. Most of it was dumped in 
the Barents Sea (12.844 kc) and the Kara Sea (11.5 kc). Most of 
the solid radioactive waste (SRW) submerged in the northern seas 
consisted of cold waste and medium-activity waste. Total 
activity is 40 c in the Barents Sea and over 15 kc in the Kara 
Sea. In 1992, 3,066 m[.sup]3[/] of LRW with activity of 18 c 
was dumped in the northern seas. 
  Radiation readings in the SRW burial sites (prior to 1967) 
and the LRW dump sites (prior to 1990) registered no cases of 
dangerous radioactive pollution directly in the disposal sites 
and the surrounding water. For the last 25 years, however, 
radiation levels have not been measured directly in the SRW 
disposal sites. 
  Far Eastern seas: Hydrological conditions in these 
deep seas depend on water exchange with the Pacific Ocean. 
Pollutants accumulate mainly on the continental shelf. The 
sources of pollution in the Far Eastern seas are enterprises of 
electrical power engineering, the oil and gas industry, and 
public utilities. 
  Water quality in the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, in 
Nagayev and Gertner bays (Tauyskaya Inlet), was rated 
``moderately polluted'' in 1991 and 1992. No tendency toward 
pollution has been observed in the open expanses of the 
Tauyskaya Inlet in the past five years. According to available 
data, there are no indications of any such tendency in the 
southwestern part of the sea (the shelf of Sakhalin Island). We 
can say without any hesitation, however, that the environs of 
the settlement of Starodubskiy are always the most critical 
site: The water there is rated ``contaminated,'' and it is 
``highly contaminated'' in the harbor. Phenol levels have risen 
to 45 times the MAC. 
  In Petr Velikiy Gulf in the Sea of Japan, the level of 
pollution has been stabilized since 1989 in Zolotoy Rog Bay and 
in Amursk and Ussuriysk gulfs, where water quality is always 
rated ``polluted'' or ``contaminated.'' The content of dissolved 
oxygen has occasionally decreased in Zolotoy Rog Bay. The most 
highly polluted part of the Tatar Strait is always the area near 
Aleksandrovka. 
<H5>  Ground Water Use and Pollution </H5>
  Exploratory projects in Russia (in 1992) revealed the 
locations of 3,196 underground sources of potable water and 
water for the production sphere and for irrigation, with 
combined reserves of 26.7 km[.sup]3[/] a year. The sources of 
around 18.2 km[.sup]3[/] a year are ready for commercial use. 
The federation average for the use of these reserves does not 
exceed 33 percent. 
  The amount of ground water used in 1992 was 11.9* 
km[.sup]3[/], 75 percent in households, 21 percent in 
production, and 4 percent in the irrigation of fields and 
pastures. 
  Subterranean sources of water (particularly in the water 
table closest to the surface) are polluted by man's economic 
activities along with the other elements of the environment. 
According to the geological organizations of Roskomnedra [RF 
State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources], 
around 760 sites of ground water pollution have been discovered, 
and they have displayed steady levels of pollution for several 
years. They include 70 potable water intakes in Ufa, Tula, Orel, 
Tambov, Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, and other cities where the 
deterioration of water quality has been recorded. Pollution in 
320 areas is connected with the activities of industrial 
enterprises. 
  The most common sources of ground water pollution are oil 
fields, mining enterprises, leach fields, the slurry tanks and 
scrap heaps of metallurgical plants, chemical waste and 
fertilizer storage tanks, garbage dumps, animal husbandry 
complexes, and residential communities with no sewers. Sites of 
ground water pollution now cover hundreds of square kilometers. 
  The most common substances polluting the ground water are 
petroleum products, phenols, heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, 
cadmium, nickel, and mercury), sulfates, chlorides, and nitrogen 
compounds. The intensity of pollution in 30 percent of the known 
sites of ground water pollution ranges from 10 to 100 times the 
MAC, and the level of various substances in 12 percent of the 
locations exceeds 100 times the MAC. 
  There is no standard list of substances to be monitored in 
ground water, and this precludes the compilation of a precise 
map of ground water pollution. 
<H5>  1.4. Land Resources and Their Quality, Protection, and Use </H5>
  Russia's land resources in 1992 amounted to 1,709,600,000* 
hectares, including: 
  -- the land of agricultural enterprises and citizens--651 
million* hectares (38.1 percent*); 
  -- the land of populated communities--6.2 million* hectares 
(0.4 percent*); 
  -- the land used for industry, transportation, 
communications, and other nonagricultural purposes--17.7 
million* hectares (1.2 percent*); 
  -- the land of natural preserves--20.7 million* hectares 
(1.2 
percent*); 
  -- the land of forests--878.1 million* hectares (51.4 
percent*); 
  -- the land of water resources--18.1 million* hectares (1 
percent*); 
  -- reserve lands--117.8 million* hectares (6.9 percent*). 
  Changes in the structure of agricultural land resources are 
interesting (Table 1.4.1).

  As Table 1.4.1 indicates, agricultural land represents 13 
percent of all land resources (222.3 million* hectares). 
  Figure 1.4.1 illustrates the share of total land resources 
occupied by plowed fields. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-28A>           Figure 1.4.1. Percentage of Total </FIG>



  The area of agricultural land decreased by 12.4 million* 
hectares in the last 27 years, including a decrease of 2.3 
million* hectares in plowed fields and 10.6 million* hectares in 
hayfields. The reasons for the reduction of agricultural area 
are the destruction and degradation of topsoil and the inclusion 
of some agricultural land in the territory of cities, 
settlements, and industrial enterprises. 
  Changes in the plowed area in different parts of the Russian 
Federation are presented in Figure 1.4.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-28B>           Figure 1.4.2. Changes in 1992 Plowed </FIG>



  Russia's chernozem soils cover an area of around 120 million 
hectares. This is only around 7 percent of the total area, but 
this is the location of more than half of all the plowed fields 
and the source of around 80 percent of all farming products. 
  The distribution of agricultural soils is presented in Table 
1.4.2.

<H5>  [No 22, 1993 pp 4-9] </H5>
  Erosion-prone and eroded agricultural land covers an area of 
124 million hectares (56 percent), including 87.3 million 
hectares of plowed fields. According to 1990 state records, 
gullies covered an area of 2.4 million hectares, 26.2 million 
hectares of plowed fields (20.4 percent) were located on eroded 
soils, 2.1 million hectares (1.7 percent) had suffered from the 
combined effects of water and wind erosion, 7.9 million hectares 
(6.1 percent) had been damaged by wind erosion, and all of the 
land prone to wind erosion covered an area of 44 million 
hectares (32.2 percent). Areas of eroded chernozems are growing. 
In the last 15-20 years they have increased by an average of 
250,000-300,000 hectares a year. In many locations with 
chernozem soils, 50 percent or more of the plowed area is 
eroded. The growth of gullies results in the loss of 
25,000-30,000 hectares of chernozem each year. 
  Soil protection efforts have decreased in recent years. 
Shallow cultivation with the retention of stubble on the surface 
was conducted on an area of 19.7 million hectares and 
cross-plowing on inclines was conducted on 13.7 million hectares 
in 1991. These figures were below the 1988 figures by 8.6 
million and 5.9 hectares respectively. Protective forest strips 
were planted on 16,100 fewer hectares in 1992 than in 1991. 
  The productivity of soil is declining in large areas as a 
result of the lower humus content. The supply was reduced by 
25-30 percent in just the last 20 years, and average annual 
losses in the Russian Federation as a whole amount to 81.4 
million tonnes. According to the data of agrochemical 
inspections, 16.5 million hectares of plowed fields in Russia 
are distinguished by an extremely low humus content, and another 
21 million hectares have a low content. The humus content of 
chernozems in the central chernozem oblasts has been reduced by 
almost half in the last 100 years--declining from 10-14 percent 
to 7-10 percent, and annual losses of humus in chernozem soils 
average 0.5-1.0 tonnes per hectare. 
  The area of reclaimed land in an unsatisfactory state has 
been reduced by 105,000 hectares in the Russian Federation as a 
whole. Around 771,000 hectares of irrigated land is in an 
unsatisfactory state, including 325,000 hectares where the water 
table is too deep, 292,000 hectares damaged by salinization, and 
154,000 hectares suffering from a combination of these two 
factors. The total area of saline lands is 38.4 million hectares 
(19.9 percent of all agricultural land), including 25.6 million 
hectares of alkaline-saline soils. Plowed fields with saline 
soils cover an area of 12.9 million hectares. 
  Waterlogged and boggy areas used as plowland are increasing. 
In 1990 they covered 8 million hectares (5.2 percent of the 
plowed fields), whereas there were 5.8 million hectares (or 4.5 
percent) in 1985. 
  Desertification has damaged 4.9 million hectares in 
Kalmykia, 
and 1.8 million of these are in a state of extreme 
desertification. Degraded pastures in Astrakhan Oblast cover an 
area of 1.3 million hectares, including 250,000 hectares of 
shifting sands. Severely and moderately eroded lands occupy 48 
percent of all the pastures. 
  The degradation of pastures also occurs in the tundra zone 
as 
a result of parching, the destruction of the soil cover and the 
vegetative cover during the broad-scale exploitation of mineral 
deposits and the use of the pastures by motor vehicles in 
locations without proper roads, and the overgrazing of 
livestock. Between 1965 and 1990 the area of reindeer grazing 
lands decreased by 20.2 million* hectares. 
  The total area of land damaged by mining, construction, and 
geological prospecting amounted to 1.1 million hectares in 1991, 
including 700,000 hectares damaged between 1976 and 1991. More 
than 50 percent of the area was occupied by agricultural land. 
During this period, 1,341,700 hectares of damaged lands were 
recultivated. 
<H5>  Pollution of the Soil With Pesticides </H5>
  The quantity of pesticides used in agriculture each year did 
not change between 1980 and 1991 and amounted to approximately 
150,000 tonnes. The figure decreased to 100,000 tonnes in 1992. 
  The use of pesticides in the different economic regions of 
the Russian Federation in 1992 is illustrated in Figure 1.4.3. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-30A>           Figure 1.4.3. Use of Pesticides in RF </FIG>



  In Russia as a whole in 1992, soil polluted by pesticides 
was 
found in 5.8 percent of the monitored area of 29,800 hectares in 
spring and in 9.3 percent of the monitored area of 32,000 
hectares in fall. Lower levels of pesticides were recorded in 
the soils of Omsk Oblast in 1992, but the rate of soil pollution 
remained the same in Maritime Kray and Irkutsk, Samara, Rostov, 
and Moscow oblasts. The soil of orchards and forests 
(representing 37-52 percent of the monitored area) was the most 
highly contaminated by pesticide residue (mainly DDT). Fields of 
vegetable crops were polluted by the residue of DDT, 2,4-D, and 
trephalan on 17.7 percent of the area; the soil of grain fields 
was polluted by DDT, HCCH, 2,4-D, propazine, trephalan, and TCNP 
on 11.3 percent of the area. The regions with high levels of 
pollution include Moscow and Irkutsk oblasts, and average levels 
were found in the soils of the Central-Chernozem Region, 
Maritime Kray, the North Caucasus, and Kurgan Oblast. 
Territories with little pollution included Omsk Oblast and all 
but a few oblasts of the Upper Volga and cis-Volga regions. 
<H5>  Pollution of Soils by Toxic Substances of Industrial Origin </H5>
  According to the data of aerospace mapping, the zones of 
dispersion of technogenic emissions around industrial complexes 
cover an area of 18 million hectares, or 1 percent of the total 
area of the Russian Federation. 
  Emissions of pollutants from stationary sources per unit of 
area are illustrated in Figure 1.4.4. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-30B>           Figure 1.4.4. Harmful Emissions from </FIG>



  Although the average maximum figure is 0.2-0.23 
tonnes/km[.sup]2[/], local figures can reach as high as 10 
tonnes/km[.sup]2[/] (in the Ural, Central, and 
Central-Chernozem economic regions). 
  The area of the soil cover polluted by heavy metals and 
fluorine has been estimated at 3.579 billion hectares. 
Territories with a highly polluted soil cover (from 10 to 100 
times the background level) cover an area of 253 million 
hectares. 
  In all of the territories surveyed in 1992, the highest 
level 
of pollution by heavy metals were found in the soil in the 
5-kilometer zone around the city of Rudnaya Pristan, the grounds 
of enterprises in Svirsk and Verkhnyaya Pyshma, and the soils of 
Irkutsk, Cheremkhovo, and Nizhneudinsk. 
  Lead in excess of 10 times the MAC was found in the soils of 
Irkutsk, Svirsk, Rudnaya Pristan, Kamensk-Uralskiy, and 
Cheremkhovo. 
  A copper content 10 times as high as the average was found 
in 
the soil of Zavolzhye, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kirov, Tomsk, and 
Rudnaya Pristan. 
  Vanadium levels exceeding 10 times the MAC were recorded in 
Kirov and Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  Fluorine pollutes the soils around enterprises of the 
aluminum industry in Krasnoturyinsk, Bratsk, Novokuznetsk, 
Volgograd, and Krasnoyarsk. The maximum concentration of total 
fluorine in the soils of these regions is 4-10 times the 
background level, and the level of water-soluble fluorine is 
10-30 times the MAC. 
  The density of atmospheric fluoride precipitation in 1991 
was 
1.5 times as high as the 1983 figure around the Bratsk Aluminum 
Plant, and 4 times the 1983 figure near the Irkutsk plant. 
  The petroleum content of soil in locations of oil 
extraction, 
refining, transport, and distribution is dozens of times as high 
as the background level. 
  The average content of petroleum products in the soils of 
Avtozavodskiy Rayon in Nizhniy Novgorod in 1992 was four times 
as high as the background level, and the content in 7 percent of 
the samples was 10 times as high. The content of petroleum in 
the soil 10 kilometers east and west of Vladimir was 33 times as 
high as the background level. 
  The petroleum content of the grounds of a refinery in 
Volgograd was 13 times as high as the background level, and it 
was 3-19 times as high in the soil of the Omsk Fuel and 
Lubricant Depot. 
<H5>  1.5. Mineral Use and Protection of Mineral Resources </H5>
  Russia ranks high in the world in terms of mineral resource 
potential. The State Commission on Commercial Mineral Deposits 
has approved around 90 percent of all known deposits and 
confirmed their reliability, profitability, and readiness for 
industrial exploitation. 
  Lead, tungsten, antimony, mercury, load and placer gold, 
silver, and phosphorite resources, however, are limited. There 
are almost no reserves of high-grade manganese, chromite, and 
kaolin ore, barite, graphite, and native sulfur. 
  The sharp cuts in exploratory and geological work in the 
last 
five years reduced the Russian Federation's state reserves of 
coal, chromites, lead, nickel in rich sulfide and silicate ores, 
antimony, mercury, platinum, silver, phosphorite, and fluorspar. 
The increase in stocks of bauxite, tin, molybdenum, diamonds, 
barite, apatite, phosphorite, asbestos, and potash salts in 1992 
was not equivalent to the annual output. 
  Although the projected resources of the main types of crude 
minerals are two or three times as great as known reserves, most 
of them are of inferior quality and are located in worse 
geographic and economic conditions. 
  Most of the deposits being worked at this time have large 
stocks of ore of fairly good quality. Stocks of aluminum, lead, 
molybdenum, tungsten, and several nonmetalliferous commercial 
minerals, however, are inferior to foreign supplies. 
  The intensive exploitation of deposits is depleting the 
resource base of many mining enterprises in the old mining 
regions. Iron ore enterprises in the Urals and West Siberia, 
copper, nickel, and bauxite enterprises in the Urals, lead and 
zinc enterprises in the North Caucasus, Transbaykal, and the Far 
East, tin ore enterprises in Maritime and Khabarovsk krays and 
Chukotka, diamond mining enterprises in Yakutia, and most of the 
gold mining enterprises in Siberia cannot develop the necessary 
capacity either because of inadequate resource reserves or 
because of the difficulty of extracting remaining supplies. 
  The output of almost all types of crude minerals has 
decreased since the end of the 1980s, particularly the output of 
oil and coal (Table 1.5.1).

** Including gas condensate. 


  The reduced output of oil and the lower growth rate in gas 
production are the result of the protracted intensive 
exploitation of highly productive deposits with essentially 
unique reserves and of cuts in capital investments in 
hydrocarbon extraction. 
  Losses of some types of commercial minerals during 
extraction 
and processing are still high. Particularly large quantities are 
lost in the earth in the underground mining of coal (25.7 
percent), including coking coal (18.3 percent), chromium ore 
(27.7 percent), and potash salts (60.1 percent). Losses of 
extracted minerals during processing include more than a third 
of the tin, around one-fourth of the iron, tungsten, molybdenum, 
potassium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide from phosphorite ores, 
and one-fifth of the lead and zinc. Although the final 
extraction yields in 1992 were higher than the 1991 figures by 
1.4 percent for coking coal, 0.4 percent for iron ore, 0.3 
percent for tungsten-molybdenum ore, and 2.5 percent for potash 
salts, and although concentration recovery figures were 1.9 
percent higher for iron, 1.4 percent higher for zinc, and 0.8 
percent higher for tin, the yield of the majority of commercial 
minerals was nevertheless smaller than in 1987 (tables 1.5.2 and 
1.5.3).

  Complete raw material use is still at a low level. 
Enterprises of the Apatit Association in Murmansk Oblast recover 
only 40 percent of the potential value of apatite-nepheline ore 
in their commercial product. Thousands of tonnes of nepheline 
and titanium are lost with the tailings. The oxidized 
ferruginous quartzite extracted along with ores by mining 
enterprises of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly are not processed and 
are kept in scrap heaps. Copper, cobalt, and sulfur are not 
recovered from the iron ore in some deposits, noble and 
nonferrous metals and trace elements are not recovered from the 
pyrite concentrates of copper pyrite deposits treated with 
sulfuric acid, and nonferrous metals are not recovered during 
the dressing of tin ores.

  Around 8.2 billion m[.sup]3[/] of casing-head gas burned 
in 1992. The use of this gas during oil extraction was just as 
unsatisfactory as it had been the year before. Losses of sulfur 
from fuel gas and of helium and ethane from natural gas 
increased. 
  The accumulated waste products (45 billion tonnes) of 
ore-dressing enterprises (including more than 10 billion tonnes 
at enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy) are not 
being put to satisfactory use. 
  Enterprises were more inclined to practice the selective 
working of the best sections of deposits, which led to the 
accumulation of underground stocks of commercial minerals of 
inferior quality: the Norilskiy Nikel concern (Krasnoyarsk 
Kray), the Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum combine 
(Kabardino-Balkar Republic), and the Gaysk Ore-Dressing Combine 
(GOK) (Orenburg Oblast). 
  Because mineral extraction and processing facilities are 
having a destructive effect on the environment, the intelligent 
and comprehensive use of mineral resources is a priority of 
environmental protection in the locations of mining enterprises. 
  The development of the sites of mineral deposits is an acute 
problem in several mining regions. In the Kuzbass, for example, 
each year the sites of coal deposits are developed, but the 
reserves in these deposits exceed 100 million tonnes, and this 
will complicate the working of these deposits in the future. 
Construction projects on the sites of potash salt deposits in 
the damaged left-bank section of the city of Berezniki have 
continued. This problem has to be solved on the federal level, 
specifically by the legislative restriction of construction in 
mining regions. 
  Therefore, the state of affairs in the use of the crude 
mineral base and the protection of mineral resources is still on 
the verge of rapid deterioration. 
  The resolution of many problems in the protection of mineral 
resources is connected directly with the need to improve 
existing laws on mineral resources and the creation of an 
economic mechanism for the intelligent use of these resources. 
  In addition to the unsatisfactory use of commercial minerals 
during the stages of extraction and processing, the prospecting 
and exploitation of deposits can cause irreversible changes in 
the landscape, the appropriation of land, the disruption of 
hydrological patterns, and the pollution of the environment. 
There is a great risk of ecological catastrophes at the time of 
accidents accompanied by emissions, oil spills, and fires in gas 
and oil wells and coal mines. 
<H5>  1.6. Forests and Their Use, Reproduction, and Protection </H5>
  The total area of Russia's forests amounts to 1,182,600,000* 
hectares, including 771 million* hectares of dense forests (65 
percent of the total) with timber reserves of 81.6 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/] (according to forest inventory records). The 
distribution of dense forests in different regions of Russia is 
illustrated in Figure 1.6.1. Russia's forests are mainly 
coniferous--78 percent* (cedar--6.2 percent*), deciduous 
softwood--19 percent*, and deciduous hardwood--3 percent*. The 
total forested area suitable for exploitation (logging 
operations) covers 388.5 million* hectares, or 38 percent* of 
the total, with timber reserves of 47.6 billion* m[.sup]3[/] 
(66 percent*). The area of mature and overmature trees covers 
183.3 million* hectares, with reserves of 29.1 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/]. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-34A>           Figure 1.6.1. Densely Wooded Area </FIG>



  The felling limit (or consumption standard) in the Russian 
Federation as a whole was 542.5 million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992, 
including 330.2 million* m[.sup]3[/] of conifers. The 
overfelling of conifers, by 1.7 million* m[.sup]3[/], was 
recorded only in Arkhangelsk Oblast. This was done with the 
permission of the oblast administration. 
  The public felling area has decreased from 2 million 
hectares 
in 1988 to 1.4 million* hectares (see Table 1.6.1). There have 
been no significant changes in cutting methods and technologies. 
Clear-cutting is still practiced on around 90 percent* of the 
total cutting area.

  Forest fires are still causing colossal damage to forests 
(Table 1.6.3). The area consumed by these fires has recently 
exceeded a million hectares a year, and in 1992 it totaled 1.143 
million* hectares, exceeding the 1991 area by 17,000* hectares.

** An estimated 75,000 rubles per hectare of forested area in 1993 prices, 
by analogy with UN data, as the minimum fire damage figure used in 
estimates in foreign countries. 


  The active protection of forests from fire is conducted on 
an 
area of 770 million* hectares. The biggest fire zones in 1992 
were in the forests of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia)--305,000* 
hectares, and Amur Oblast--135,000* hectares. 
  As a result of fires in past years, large areas of dry trees 
were recorded in Tyumen Oblast (24,500 ha) and Irkutsk Oblast 
(12,000 ha) in 1992. For that same reason, areas of dead trees 
per 1,000 hectares of wooded area were 3.44 hectares in 
Kaliningrad Oblast, 4.15 ha in Leningrad Oblast, and 5.52 ha in 
Vladimir Oblast. 
  The area of forests dying as a result of adverse external 
factors has been increasing in the last three years (353,500* ha 
in 1990, 595,500* ha in 1991, and 543,600* ha in 1992). The 
largest areas of trees killed by industrial emissions are 
located in the environs of the Norilsk Combine, where these 
areas increased by 61,300 hectares in 1992 alone. The 
dessication and degradation of forests on an area of 90,000 
hectares was recorded within the exposure zones of the 
Severonikel and Pechenganikel combines in Murmansk Oblast, and 
all of the trees in the forests covering an area of 15,000 
hectares here are dead. 
  The increasingly severe radioactive pollution of these 
forests is alarming. Zones of pollution by radionuclides were 
recorded in the forests of 15 oblasts, and the Chernobyl 
accident alone was responsible for this kind of damage on an 
area equivalent to 1.3 million hectares. 
  Zones of forest pests and diseases, which also cause the 
dessication and death of trees, covered an area of 2.9 million* 
hectares in 1992. In the West Siberian Economic Region, for 
example, desiccated trees in the zones of forest insect pests 
(the sudden mass proliferation of the Siberian silkworm moth) 
represented 60 percent of the total area of dead forests. 
Measures were taken to combat forest pests and diseases on an 
area of 486,000* hectares in 1992. 
  In the past five years the death of trees and the practice 
of 
clear-cutting have resulted in the loss of 13 million hectares 
of wooded area. Furthermore, reforestation (measured in terms of 
the final stage) has been carried out on an area of only 6.9 
million hectares, or 52.9 percent. In 1992 reforestation 
projects were launched on an area of 1.402 million* hectares, 
and saplings were reclassified as commercial timber on 1.426 
million* hectares. Burned-out forests and dead trees cover a 
total area of 26.5 million hectares in the Russian Federation. 
  The improvement of the state of RF forests will require 
immediate measures to manage forest resources more efficiently, 
protect the forests, and secure their intelligent use. This 
could be promoted by the adoption and implementation of state 
reforestation and fire protection programs and the passage of 
new forest laws. 
  Experts have said that Russia's flora is in a disastrous 
state, but the absence of inventories of plant resources and 
facilities (with the exception of forests) precludes objective 
appraisals of the situation in the country as a whole and in 
different regions. 
<H3>  1.7. Flora and Fauna and Their Present State, Use, and 
Protection </H3>
<H5>  Flora </H5>
  The state of natural plant communities in the arid 
cis-Caspian zone is alarming. The uncontrolled growth of 
anthropogenic influences and the inefficient use of the land, 
without adequate reclamation, have caused the degeneration of 
native plants and the degradation and destruction of the 
vegetative ground cover on large areas. The natural plant 
communities of the steppes and meadows are being diminished, and 
the area of deteriorating tundra communities is increasing. 
  In spite of the somewhat stabilized area of the forests, as 
one type of vegetation, their qualitative indicators have 
declined, and the area covered by dessicated and dead trees has 
increased in some regions. 
  Plant communities are damaged during reclamation projects. 
The broad-scale drainage of wooded areas, for example, has 
impoverished the gene pool of many unique marsh plant 
communities. In particular, whole groves of marshwort were lost 
in Ivanovo Oblast. 
  The unfounded and unofficial procurements of medicinal herbs 
and other useful plants are cause for serious concern, 
particularly the gathering of these plants by cooperatives and 
private entrepreneurs. This has led to the intensive depletion 
of stocks of wild flora and the destruction of plant communities 
that took centuries to become established. In the North Caucasus 
this practice has undermined reserves of ramson (bear's onion), 
in Moscow Oblast the supply of male fern is being depleted, in 
Ivanovo Oblast the stocks of common valerian and bistort have 
been reduced, and in Krasnodar Kray the common St. John's wort 
and yarrow have become rare species. 
  The ground cover is being damaged by the unwarranted 
authorization of gardening and vegetable farming on territories 
with unique plant communities and in forest preserves, 
sanctuaries, and natural monuments. This has occurred in 
Krasnodar Kray, Moscow Oblast, and several other Russian oblasts. 
  The degradation of the plant cover as a whole has been 
accompanied by additions to the list of species in danger of 
extinction, or endangered plants. The RF Red Book now contains 
information on 533 species of flora requiring protection in the 
country: 440 angiospermae (flowering), 11 gymnospermae, 10 
ferns, 4 lycopsids, 22 mushrooms, 29 lichens, and 17 fungi. 
Several species of plants have completely disappeared. In recent 
years, for example, the king fern (Krasnodar Kray), the Volga 
cinquefoil (Central Cis-Volga), the mercury squill (Far East), 
and many others were registered as extinct species. 
  The problem of preserving the specific diversity of flora 
can 
only be solved by securing the proper protection of the habitats 
of species, plant communities, and natural ecosystems. The 
number of species of vascular plants in different 
botanical-geographic regions is illustrated in Figure 1.7.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-36A>           Figure 1.7.1. Number of Species of </FIG>



  The stability of terrestrial ecosystems was evaluated within 
the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' program, with a view 
to the indicators of supplies of living biological matter and 
dead organic substances, phytoproductivity, specific diversity, 
and the mosaic patterns of the vegetative cover (Figure 1.7.2). 
The use of an integral index of the stability of terrestrial 
ecosystems can secure consideration for the distinctive features 
of the natural component during the planning of regional 
resource use strategy. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-37A>           Figure 1.7.2. Integral Assessment of </FIG>



  The fundamentals of RF legislation on flora must be adopted 
without delay and the planning of a state policy and its 
implementation through the appropriate programs will be required 
for the establishment of the economic and legal basis for the 
intelligent use and protection of plant resources. 
<H5>  Fauna and the State of Habitats </H5>
  The abundance and specific diversity of Russia's fauna 
depend 
directly on the quality of animal habitats. There are three 
separate categories of territories with fairly distinct 
characteristics, depending on the degree of transformation 
resulting from economic activity. 
  The first category is the territory with developed industry 
and agriculture and high population density. The Central and 
Central-Chernozem regions, the cis-Volga, the Volga-Kama zone, 
the North Caucasus, the Urals, and the cis-Ural region belong to 
this category. Here the ratio of forests and open spaces has 
reached the critical level, predetermining considerably 
diminished fauna with a lack of balance in numbers and in specie 
composition. The disruption of the fragile ecological balance in 
these regions could have the most unpredictable results, ranging 
from the loss of certain species to the possibility of a 
dramatic increase in their numbers and outbreaks of various 
epizootic diseases. 
  The second group consists of territories of intensive 
development, industrial construction, the rapid growth of 
extractive branches, and the establishment of a new economic 
structure. The group includes the northern zone of the ETR, the 
new industrial and agricultural zones of Siberia and the Far 
East, and the regions of the West Siberian gas and oil fields, 
where the deterioration of wildlife habitats is still localized. 
This is primarily connected with logging, plowing, hydraulic 
engineering, reclamation, the direct pollution of soil, water, 
and plants with petroleum products, and the agitation and stress 
caused by hunting. 
  The third group consists of territories with a traditional 
economic structure, virtually untouched by change. These are the 
vast expanses in the Siberian north and east, the northeastern 
part of the ETR, and the Far East. The state of fauna here is 
relatively stable because the economy is geared directly to the 
use of animal resources. 
  The main strategic objective in the stabilization of the 
specific composition and numbers of fauna in the next few years 
consists in determining the allowable areas and parameters of 
human activity in protected seats of biodiversity, which include 
wetlands in highly developed regions and regions of average 
development, the floodplains of the same regions and of 
hydraulic engineering construction sites; territories where 
endemic species of animals are concentrated (Maritime Kray, 
Sakhalin Island, and the North Caucasus); sections of the steppe 
in zones of widespread agricultural development. Measures should 
also be taken without delay for government protection and 
monitoring of animals in the logging regions of Siberia and the 
European north and in zones of gas and oil production. 
<H5>  Animal Resources and Their Use and Protection </H5>
  Invertebrates are distinguished by the highest number of 
species (around 80,000) and the lowest level of our knowledge of 
the distribution and numbers of individual species. The most 
vulnerable invertebrates are the fauna groups of the European 
plains and oak woods, some parts of Lake Baykal, the Caspian 
Sea, and other large bodies of water, the groups of Caucasian 
cave-dwellers, and those associated with certain types of flora 
and mountain peaks. Habitat deterioration and excessive fishing 
have reduced the numbers of certain species and have led to the 
imposition of bans on fishing for scallops, crab, sea cucumber, 
trepan, and mussels in some parts of Maritime Kray and the Black 
Sea. Stocks of fresh-water invertebrates--crayfish, pearl 
oysters, river oysters, and medicinal leeches--have been 
diminished perceptibly by the same factors. The RF Red Book now 
lists 34 species of insects and 15 species of mollusks. 
  Among vertebrates, the amphibian class is represented by 
only 
24 species in the Russian Federation, and the Ussuriysk clawed 
newt, the Asia Minor newt, the Caucasian frog, and the rush toad 
are listed in the Russian Red Book. There are no reliable data 
on the numbers of amphibians. Each year up to 500,000 lake frogs 
are caught for export, and 200,000-300,000 grass frogs and 
leopard frogs are trapped for medical and biological 
institutions. 
  Reptiles achieve maximum diversity and numbers in the arid 
and semi-arid oblasts. For example, 21 of the 69 species 
recorded in the Russian Federation live in limited sections of 
the European south of Russia, and there are only 1-7 species in 
the rest of the ETR and in most of Siberia. All species of 
reptiles and amphibians are trapped and kept as pets. The 
underground trade in these species cannot be estimated at this 
time, but their constantly rising prices arouse serious concern 
about the state of their populations. The virtually unrestricted 
operations of the private firms that sprang up in the last few 
years for the production of poisons pose a genuine threat to the 
future of even a species as ubiquitous as the common adder. 
Eleven species of reptiles are listed in the RF Red Book. 
  The distribution of varieties of ornithological species in 
different Russian territories is illustrated in Figure 1.7.3.

  According to the Russian State Committee for Statistics, the 
total bag of waterfowl in Russia is 4-5 million a year, but 
experts believe it is 12-13 million. The situation in the tundra 
and forest-tundra zones has remained satisfactory, except for 
the regions of the Bolshaya Zemlya tundra and the Yamal 
Peninsula, where intensive economic development has reduced the 
numbers of some species. In the forest zone there is a tendency 
toward a decrease in numbers everywhere. Even in East Siberia, 
the situation could be described as pre-depressive. The habitats 
of waterfowl in Maritime Kray have changed dramatically. 
  The great variety of Russia's mammals is illustrated in 
Figure 1.7.4. The variety of ungulates and carnivores is 
illustrated separately in figures 1.7.5 and 1.7.6.

  The development of market relations is directly jeopardizing 
the survival of Russian fauna. The excessive demand for furs, 
reindeer antlers, bear gall, the musk of the musk deer, and 
other products has resulted in a new outbreak of poaching. The 
illegal hunting of wildlife has become a criminally destructive 
practice. 
  Resources of commercial game animals, such as Kamchatka 
beavers, fur seals, and some other types of seals, are being 
depleted, and the numbers of steppe polecat, lynx, glutton, 
yellow-throated marten, Himalayan bear, wood grouse, bustards, 
predatory birds, and waders are dwindling. The European 
population of saiga, the numbers of some strains of mountain 
sheep and goats, Siberian wildcats, Mongolian gazelle, steppe 
falcon, some species of pheasant, and some other species have 
reached the critical point. 
  Commercial fishing for aquatic invertebrates and the 
collection of snake venom and of rare and endangered species of 
birds and insects are virtually unrestricted. 
  To a considerable extent, this has occurred because the 
functions of government administration and control were not 
separated completely from the functions of resource use, and the 
Law of the RSFSR ``On the Protection and Use of Fauna'' and 
earlier RF Government decisions were not brought into conformity 
with the requirements of the Law of the RSFSR ``On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment.'' Hunting and fishing 
inspection agencies were under separate jurisdiction, were not 
supplied with the most essential materials and equipment, and 
became entangled in the fights over the division of authority 
with agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  As a result, in spite of the widespread violations of 
hunting 
regulations, environmental agencies discovered 15,000 fewer 
cases of poaching in 1992 than in the previous year. There are 
no records of the numbers and bag of even the most common 
species of animals, and information received from various 
sources is extremely fragmented and contradictory. The group of 
fees for the use of animal resources has not been finalized yet. 
  Therefore, the standards and structure of government 
management of animal resources do not meet the requirements of 
the developing market economy, and the commercial use of 
biological resources is acquiring chaotic features and has 
escaped government control. 
<H3>  1.8. Fish Resources and Their Present State, Use, 
Protection, and Reproduction </H3>
  Fresh-water basins in the Russian Federation annually yield 
around 200,000* tonnes of fish. More than 60 percent of the 
catch comes from the basins of large rivers, lakes, and 
reservoirs. Under the conditions of market relations in recent 
years, the leasing of commercial ponds and fishing areas, and 
the sale of fishing licenses for game fish, there has been a 
tendency toward smaller catches (Table 1.8.1).

  Fish stocks in the waters of the Ob-Irtysh basin, 
including the Obsk and Tazov coves, are in unsatisfactory 
condition, except for the whitefish. Feeding conditions have 
been affected adversely in the last three years by the drop in 
the water level. The catch of commercial game fish--nelma, 
muksun, and peliad--is decreasing. The catch of whitefish 
depends on fishing conditions and the organization of fisheries. 
The catch in remote regions has decreased dramatically. 
  The Yenisey River, with its low level of 
biological productivity, is marked by the dramatic reduction of 
the supply and catch of the main commercial species--whitefish 
and sig--due to the regulation of runoff from the Krasnoyarsk 
GES. 
  There are strict limits on sturgeon, nelma, salmon trout, 
and 
sig fishing in the Lena River. The catch of sig is 
being reduced by the effects of industrial sewage. The total 
catch can only be increased by the addition of small fish caught 
in fine-mesh nets and crucian carp. 
  In most lakes the catch of commercial species--salmon, 
whitefish, and fish caught in large nets (pike perch, pike, and 
even bream in some cases)--is far in excess of allowable limits, 
whereas reserves of species with less commercial value are 
underutilized. This is causing undesirable changes in the 
composition of ichthyofauna, replacing valuable species with 
roach, perch, and ruff. 
  In Lake Ladoga, which has been affected severely 
by industrial and household sewage, reserves of sig are being 
reduced by the eutrophication of the lake. Stocks of small fish 
are underutilized. The catch of smelt is increasing, but the 
catch of pike perch, bream, and pike is decreasing. 
  In Lake Onega the resource base could yield a 
sizable catch of smelt and whitefish--the main commercial fish. 
The reduction of the catch is due to economic factors. 
  Stocks of whitefish in Lake Pskovsko-Chudskoye can 
be described as small, and reserves of sig are smaller than in 
earlier years. Stocks of pike perch and pike are satisfactory. 
The intense pollution of the lake with petroleum products, 
phenols, and heavy metal salts and the loss of most of the fish 
in winter have affected the natural reproduction of these 
reserves and the size of stocks and catches. 
<H5>  [No 23, 1993 pp 5-12] </H5>
  Lake Ilmen is distinguished by stable reserves of 
bream and satisfactory reserves of pike. The number of pike 
perch has decreased perceptibly, resulting in the institution of 
a fishing limit. More than 50 percent of the catch in the lake 
consists of small fish. 
  A fishing limit on omul, the main commercial fish in Lake 
Baykal, has resulted in the efficient use of omul 
reserves. Reserves of burbot are satisfactory. The catch limit 
on pike, ide, and carp is the result of the poor organization of 
hatcheries and the plundering of these species. 
<H5>  Volga Reservoirs </H5>
  Stocks of pelagian fish are increasing in the 
Rybinskoye Reservoir because of the growth of the 
supply of plankton in connection with the eutrophication of the 
basin. The catch of bottom fish is decreasing, and particularly 
quickly in the case of burbot and pike, as a result of the 
pollution of the reservoir by the Cherepovets Metallurgical 
Combine. 
  Stocks of bream are in a satisfactory state in the 
Kuybyshev Reservoir and constitute 35 percent of the 
total catch here. The reduced catch of pike, catfish, and burbot 
is connected with organizational difficulties. Reserves of small 
fish are being underutilized. 
  Bream reserves are stable in the Saratov 
Reservoir. Stocks of pike perch and pike are small because they 
are highly vulnerable to unfavorable hydrological conditions 
during the spawning season. Sterlet stocks have been stable 
since the fishery opened in 1989. The total yield is close to 
the optimum. Reserves of small fish are being underutilized. 
Herbivorous fish are accounting for an ever greater percentage 
of the catch, and the stocks of these have been estimated at 
1,500-1,700 tonnes. 
  Reserves of the main species in the Volgograd 
Reservoir have been given a satisfactory rating. The reduced 
catch is due to the high water level in recent years. Supplies 
of herbivorous fish and small fish are being underutilized. 
  The Tsimlyansk Reservoir has also acquired 
commercial significance. Reserves of most species have a 
satisfactory rating. Bream is the main fish here, and the total 
catch depends on the state of bream stocks. The catch in recent 
years has amounted to 5,000-6,000 tonnes. It is a limited 
species along with pike perch and blue bream. The carp 
populations are small. 
<H5>  Marine Basins </H5>
  The total catch of fish in the Barents Sea was 
around 600,000 tonnes (including 400,000 tonnes of capelin), as 
compared to 520,000 tonnes in 1991. The cod catch increased from 
114,000 tonnes (1991) to 170,000 (1992) as a result of the 
gradual growth of commercial reserves in the seas of the 
northeast Atlantic. 
  Commercial stocks of haddock (330,000 tonnes) were below the 
average, and stocks of black halibut (around 80,000 tonnes), 
brown snapper (215,000 tonnes), plaice (around 30,000 tonnes), 
and anarhichas species were low. Stocks of capelin decreased 
from 7 million tonnes to 5.5 million. There were also reduced 
stocks of commercial shellfish--scallops and shrimp, although 
the state of shrimp reserves is excellent. 
  Other seas of the Arctic Ocean have no commercial 
significance because they have not been explored sufficiently, 
mainly because of the climate. 
  The numbers of Baltic sprat are still increasing in the 
Baltic Sea. Commercial reserves of this fish in the 
Russian part of the sea reached 725,000 tonnes. Most of the 
herring populations are in excellent condition. Stocks of East 
Baltic cod, however, are in a critical state: Spawning reserves 
have decreased to almost one-seventh of the earlier figure in 
the last 10 years--from 776,000 tonnes in 1983 to 115,000 in 
1992. Stocks of salmon are decreasing. 
  The catch of fish in the Black Sea in 1992 
remained small and amounted to only around 28,000 tonnes, 
including around 12,000 tonnes of anchovy and 13,800 tonnes of 
sprat. Stocks of Black Sea sprat have improved since they began 
decreasing in 1991. The supply in 1992 was 500,000 tonnes. 
Stocks of perch and gray mullet are in a depressed state. 
  Commercial stocks of plaice (1,100 tonnes in 1992) and of 
Azov-Don herring are in a depressed state in the Azov 
Sea. Commercial stocks of sandre amount to 15,000 tonnes, the 
lowest figure of the last decade. Azov anchovy stocks amounted 
to 90,000 tonnes in 1992, and the Russian catch was 2,700 
tonnes. Supplies of sea roach are low. The populations of common 
and starred sturgeon were satisfactory. 
  In the Caspian Sea there was a large catch of 
bream--13,700 tonnes--and Caspian roach--19,900 tonnes. The 
catch of sandre increased in all regions. Stocks of carp and 
catfish were in good condition. The catch of sturgeon in Russia 
amounted to 7,300 tonnes, including 4,240 tonnes of common 
sturgeon, 2,560 tonnes of starred sturgeon, and 460 tonnes of 
beluga. The beluga displayed privation bordering on starvation. 
Commercial stocks of sterlet were estimated at 230,600 fish. 
There was still a tendency toward decrease in the sprat 
catch--168,000 tonnes in 1992 (the lowest of the last 25 years 
because of reduced breeding efforts). 
  The basins of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of 
Japan, and the Bering Sea and the adjacent 
open expanses of the northwestern Pacific now yield half of the 
Russian catch. 
  In the maritime economic zone of Russia's Far Eastern seas, 
90 percent of the catch consists of mintai, salmon, herring, 
cod, plaice, whitefish, and pollack. Mintai accounts for 71 
percent of the catch, but the stocks of mintai have decreased 
substantially in recent years, particularly in the Bering Sea, 
because of the mismanagement of fisheries. Fishing has been more 
intense in the open expanses of the Sea of Okhotsk, including 
the fishing boats of foreign states. The populations of mintai 
in that sea will be undermined unless mintai fishing in the open 
part of the sea is restricted. 
  Commercial stocks of Far East salmon are average or low, but 
the latest data on the state of certain populations attest to an 
increase in their numbers. 
  The number of Pacific herring is still low, and this will 
require the maintenance of fishing limits. 
  Stocks of cod have increased almost everywhere in the Far 
East in recent years, but the size of the populations near the 
southern Kurils is still on the low 1991 level. 
  An increase in reserves of plaice, primarily yellowfin, has 
been recorded on the West Kamchatka shelf. The rate of sardine 
reproduction in 1992 was much higher than in the previous year. 
A tendency toward the reduction of Iwashi sardine stocks has 
been noted in recent years. The high numbers of pollack fry and 
their excellent rate of survival promise large stocks. 
  Most of the stocks of commercial shellfish are concentrated 
in the seas of the Far East. Stocks of Kamchatka crab, beetle 
crab, blue crab, and spiny crab in 1992 were the same as in 
1991. Tawbatch fishing is still prohibited. Three species of 
squid are of commercial value. Domestic fishermen concentrate on 
the commodore squid, the stocks of which are stable. Reserves of 
Far Eastern brown algae are the largest in Russia, but not all 
of them are in accessible locations, and the algae supply in 
traditional fishing areas has been reduced sharply by 
unrestricted fishing and by game violations. 
  Calculations of the size of populations of sea mammals in 
the 
waters of Russia in 1992 did not reveal any significant changes 
in the state of these resources since the previous year. 
According to International Whaling Commission data, the Pacific 
gray whales of the Chukotka-California population now number 
around 20,100. 
  The fur seal population of the Commodore Islands will 
stabilize at around 225,000-230,000 seals in the next few years. 
The population in the Sea of Okhotsk is in a stable-depressed 
state and numbers around 59,000 fur seals. 
  The total number of seals in the Sea of Okhotsk is around 
1.3 
million (545,000 akiba, 405,000 fascia, 180,000 largo, and 
180,000 lachta). 
<H5>  Reproduction of Fish Resources </H5>
  At this time 114 state fisheries--sturgeon and salmon 
hatcheries, small fish farms, spawning and breeding farms, 
production-acclimatization stations, and others--are engaged in 
the reproduction of fish resources. 
  In 1992 these enterprises put more than 7.15 billion fry in 
natural ponds and reservoirs, including 104.1 million sturgeon, 
637.5 million salmon, 59.4 million sig, and 6.34 billion small 
fish and herbivorous fish. 
  Around 1.026 billion Atlantic salmon fry were released into 
the northern basin for the reproduction of stocks. 
  Most of the sturgeon and small fish fry in the Caspian and 
Azov basins come from hatcheries. Stocks of white and red salmon 
in the Caspian Sea are maintained exclusively by means of 
artificial reproduction. As a result, around 30 percent of the 
fish in the Caspian basin and more than 80 percent of the fish 
in the Azov basin come from fish farms. 
  The artificial reproduction of Pacific salmon was conducted 
at fish farms in Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and Magadan oblasts and 
Maritime and Khabarovsk krays, which produced more than 630 
million fry of humpbacked, calico, silver, and red salmon. 
  The artificial reproduction of fish stocks puts around 
70,000 
tonnes back into circulation each year. 
  The development of the artificial reproduction of fish 
stocks 
is being impeded by the progressive pollution of sources of 
water. This destroys much of the breeding stock in hatcheries, 
and the surviving fry do not always satisfy the necessary 
requirements. 
  In 1992 virtually no measures were taken to improve the 
conditions of the natural reproduction of fish resources. 
Hatchery construction and remodeling projects were suspended. 
<H5>  Effects of Ecological State of Basins on Fish Resources </H5>
  The state of fish reserves depends on the degree of 
anthropogenic influence on the ecosystems of water basins. 
  The White and Barents sea basins: There 
is no commercial fishing in Kola Bay because of severe surface 
and ground water pollution. The whole Kola River, the largest 
salmon spawning bed in Murmansk Oblast, is polluted. 
  Fish stocks in the Pechora River basin are in a depressed 
state as a result of the dumping of industrial sewage, 
stream-driving, and the extraction of sand and gravel. The catch 
of sig and nelma is only one-third or one-fourth of the previous 
level. 
  There have been changes in the ichthyofauna of the Northern 
Dvina River--the percentage of salmon and sig in the catch 
decreased from 29 percent in 1985 to 7.4 percent in 1990. In the 
Onega River the catch of plaice was 27 times larger in the 
1960's than it is now, and the catch of salmon and sig was more 
than 8 times as great in the 1960's. Salmon fishing in the river 
has been prohibited since 1989. 
  The Baltic basin: The pollution of coastal areas 
in Kaliningrad Oblast is localized and is not having a 
perceptible effect on the size of the catch yet. 
  In the eastern part of the Gulf of Riga the content of 
several heavy metals in the fish is approaching the maximum 
allowable concentration and is jeopardizing fishing in these 
regions. 
  Pollution has reduced the effectiveness of salmon and sig 
spawning in Lake Ladoga, and the reproduction of bream has 
deteriorated dramatically in the Petrokrepostnaya inlet. 
  The Azov basin: The regulation of runoff from the 
Don and Kuban rivers by power engineering and irrigation systems 
and the removal of up to 30 percent of the average annual flow 
have caused the severe deterioration of the conditions of 
natural reproduction for the main commercial fish of the Azov 
basin. The spawning beds of semianadromous fish are one-third 
their earlier size, and the spawning beds of anadromous fish are 
almost one-tenth of the earlier size. The length of submerged 
beds has decreased to almost one-fourth of the previous figure. 
Changes in continental runoff have changed the mechanism by 
which the sea is supplied with biogenic elements. 
  The pollution of coastal waters with pesticides has led to 
the accumulation of these substances in the organs and tissues 
of fish (sturgeon, sandre, and carp). 
  The reduction of continental runoff and the increasing 
pollution of the sea have led to the asphyxiation of aquatic 
animals and the death of fish and even of dolphins. 
  The operation of various types of water works is having an 
adverse effect on the state of fish resources in the Azov basin. 
The number of these installations now exceeds 1,500. 
  All of this has reduced the food supply of fish to one-half 
or one-fourth of the previous amount, and reduced the total 
catch to 60,000-120,000 tonnes, including the catch of 
commercial fresh-water fish, which was from 16 to 30 times 
(depending on the species) larger when the continental runoff 
was regulated by natural forces. The beluga and whitefish are 
almost gone. 
  The Black Sea basin: Because of the 
near-disappearance of the Azov anchovy in the Azov Sea as a 
result of the proliferation of Acnidaria, there has been 
virtually no anchovy fishing in the Black Sea for the last three 
years, although the catch here once amounted to more than 60,000 
tonnes. 
  The Caspian basin: The dramatic daily and weekly 
fluctuations in the water level, current, and temperature as a 
result of the winter operations of the Volgograd GES have 
disrupted sturgeon wintering conditions downstream of the GES. 
This has led to the resorption of roe in more than 18 percent of 
the female sturgeon and more than 21 percent of the beluga. 
These sturgeon do not spawn the next season, and this has a 
damaging effect on natural reproduction. 
  The state of fish resources is affected adversely by the 
regular pollution of the water in the Volga basin and by the 
operation of water works with defective devices for the 
protection of fish or without these devices. There are more than 
4,000 registered water intakes of various types in the Caspian 
basin: 1,900 are equipped with special devices for the 
protection of fish, 2,000 have primitive protective devices, and 
100 have no means of protecting fish. 
  The basin of the Far Eastern seas: Industrial 
sewage has polluted 55 percent of the salmon spawning beds in 
the rivers of Sakhalin Oblast. The receding water level of the 
Bolshoy Takoy River as a result of the drainage of bogs upstream 
has reduced the number of fertile autumn Pacific salmon in the 
river to a fraction of what it was. 
  The continued deterioration of ecological conditions in the 
rivers of the Far East could cause irretrievable losses of 
salmon, which, along with the sturgeon, are Russia's national 
treasures. 
<H5>  1.9. Radioactive Pollution </H5>
  The main source of the radioactive pollution of the 
environment in Russia in 1992 was still the soil of the 
territories contaminated by the accidents at the Chernobyl AES 
in 1986 and the Mayak Production Association in 1957. Winds 
lifting the radioactive dust from the soil and atmospheric 
precipitation washing it out of the soil released radionuclides 
into the air, water, and vegetative ground cover. The background 
radiation far away from these regions is the result of the 
pollution of the air everywhere by the products of earlier 
nuclear tests in the atmosphere. The influence of other 
technogenic factors was negligible and strictly localized. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of the Lower Atmosphere </H5>
  The average concentration of total beta-activity in the 
lower 
atmosphere in 1992 in Russia was around 4.6x10-15 
mc/m[.sup]3[/], which was virtually the same as the 1991 
average. 
  Outside the zones contaminated by the Chernobyl and Kyshtym 
disasters the average concentration of such radionuclides as 
cesium-137 and strontium-90 in the air was 0.4x10-15 and 
0.006x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/] respectively--i.e., virtually the 
same as before the accident at the Chernobyl AES. 
  The average rate of cesium-137 precipitation was 0.05 
c/km[.sup]2[/] a year, which was approximately half the 1991 
figure. The content of strontium-90 in atmospheric precipitation 
was below the level of detectability by methods of analyzing 
this isotope. 
  The average concentration of krypton-85 from the emissions 
of 
enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle in the lower atmosphere 
was 24x10-12 c/m[.sup]3[/] of dry air in 1992--i.e., the same 
as last year's figure. 
  The average concentration of tritium in atmospheric 
precipitation was 108x10-12 c/l, which was mainly a result of 
global factors. 
  In Kursk the average annual concentration of cesium-137 in 
the air was 0.25x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/], and the figure in 
Bryansk was 0.17x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/], which is below the 
cumulative tolerance dose for this isotope by six orders of 
magnitude. 
  The content of radionuclides in atmospheric precipitation in 
the contaminated territories of the ETR is far in excess of the 
national average. Average daily readings of total beta-activity 
and cesium-137 were 0.07 and 0.05 mc/m[.sup]2[/] in 
Novozybkiy and the maximum daily figures were 8 and 17 
mc/m[.sup]2[/] respectively. 
  There were no perceptible changes in levels of radioactive 
pollution on the grounds of nuclear power plants and other 
installations categorized as radiation hazards in 1992. The 
radiometric network of observation posts of Roskomgidromet [RF 
Committee on Hydrometeorology] did not record the presence of 
iodine-131 in the air or in atmospheric precipitation, in spite 
of the radioactive iodine released into the atmosphere at the 
Ignalina AES (22 July 1992) and the Sverdlovsk branch of the 
Scientific Research and Design Institute of Electrothermal 
Equipment. There were no nuclear tests in Russia in 1992. 
  A surface nuclear explosion of around 1 megaton, conducted 
outside Russia on 21 April 1992 on the PRC test site near Lop 
Nor, did not cause any perceptible changes in the global 
radioactive background last year. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of Territories </H5>
  The accumulation of radioisotope precipitate in the soil 
during the year was negligible everywhere in comparison with the 
total supply in the soil and had virtually no effect on the 
pollution levels that had been recorded at the end of 1991. 
  Projects in 1992 corrected some data in the 1991 report and 
expanded the boundaries of the zones of radioactive pollution by 
cesium-137 (Figure 1.9.1). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-47A>           Figure 1.9.1. Density of Cesium-137 </FIG>



  Most of the radionuclides from Chernobyl were cesium-137 and 
strontium-90, and the rate of soil pollution by strontium was 
from one-fortieth to one-one hundredth of the rate for cesium. 
  The radioactive pollution of territories as of January 1993, 
according to Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] data, and the 
population of these territories, according to the lists of the 
populated communities within the zones of radioactive pollution, 
are presented in Table 1.9.1.

  Territories with a cesium-137 soil pollution rate of 5-15 
c/m[.sup]2[/] were recorded in Bryansk (2,628 
km[.sup]2[/]), Kaluga (1,419 km[.sup]2[/]), Orel (132 
km[.sup]2[/]), and Tula (1,271 km[.sup]2[/]) oblasts, with 
a rate of 15-40 c/km[.sup]2[/] and over 40 in only Bryansk 
Oblast (2,130 km[.sup]2[/] and 310 km[.sup]2[/] 
respectively). 
  The radioactive pollution of the soil after the disaster at 
the Chernobyl AES at a rate of under 1.0 c/km[.sup]2[/] for 
cesium-137 was recorded in Krasnodar Kray (up to 1.0 
c/km[.sup]2[/]), Rostov Oblast (up to 0.9 c/km[.sup]2[/]), 
Novgorod and Volgograd oblasts and Chuvashia (up to 0.8 
c/km[.sup]2[/]), and in Tatarstan, the Republic of Mari El, 
Udmurtia, Tver Oblast, Perm Oblast, Stavropol Kray, Karelia, 
Kaliningrad Oblast, Kalmykia, Pskov Oblast, the south of the 
Komi Republic, the south of Kirov Oblast, and the Nenets 
Autonomous Okrug at a rate of 0.2-0.5 c/km[.sup]2[/]. The 
lowest levels of radioactive pollution by cesium-137 precipitate 
(commensurate with the global background level) were recorded in 
Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Vladimir, Vologda, Ivanovo, Samara, 
Moscow, Murmansk, Orenburg, Kostroma, and Yaroslavl oblasts and 
Bashkortostan. 
  Levels of pollution in agricultural crops began stabilizing 
in 1989-90, and their annual fluctuations are connected 
primarily with climatic factors. When the recommendations are 
followed, all of the farming products in territories with a 
cesium-137 pollution rate of up to 40 c/km[.sup]2[/] are fit 
for consumption in accordance with current standards. On 
agricultural land with a pollution rate of under 10 
c/km[.sup]2[/] there are no problems in the production of 
animal husbandry products meeting standard requirements. The 
planning and use of special methods of animal husbandry are 
essential only in Bryansk Oblast and part of Kaluga Oblast. 
  Radioecological surveys of 3.5 million hectares of 
agricultural land were conducted in 1992. Maps were compiled and 
were distributed to farms along with recommended methods of 
agroindustrial production management. 
  Projects in 12 oblasts improved natural grazing areas on 
47,000 hectares, limed the soil on 144,000 ha, applied 
phosphorite to the soil on 79,600 ha, and applied higher doses 
of mineral fertilizers on 242,300 ha. 
  Around 104,100 specimens of farming products and 234,700 
tonnes of animal husbandry products were inspected. The content 
of strontium-90 and cesium-137 in the grain, potatoes, 
vegetables, and fruit in all of the monitored oblasts did not 
exceed the provisional limits. The proportional quantity of 
polluted milk decreased from 7.9 percent (10,900 tonnes) in 1991 
to 5.7 percent (6,200 tonnes) in 1992, and the respective 
figures for meat were 0.12 percent (40 tonnes) in 1991 and 0.06 
percent (13 tonnes) in 1992. 
  An analysis of the radioactive pollution of forest products 
and by-products revealed that the level of cesium-137 in the 
timber on all monitored plots did not exceed the standard limit, 
but the level in mushrooms, berries, and medicinal resources on 
polluted territories rating higher than 3-5 c/km[.sup]2[/] 
require radiation inspections, and the content in areas with a 
rating of over 10 c/km[.sup]2[/] exceeds the standard limit. 
Around 85-98 percent of the artificial radionuclides are 
concentrated on the forest floor and in the top 10 centimeters 
of soil. During a fire in a forest with a pollution level of 
16-18 c/km[.sup]2[/], the concentration of radionuclides in 
aerosols on the fire's edge increases from 20 to 200 times, but 
it remains below the MAC by one order of magnitude. Winds of up 
to 10 m/sec can cause the secondary pollution of the land 
surface for a distance of up to 1.5 km. The quantity of 
radionuclides carried away by the wind from turf-covered soils 
and forests is negligible--measuring only a few hundredths of 1 
percent a year. 
  The region where the Mayak Production Association is located 
in the south Urals is distinguished by the presence of 
long-lived strontium-90 radionuclides in the composition of 
pollutants and, to a much lesser degree, cesium-137 and 
plutonium-239. 
  The rate of strontium-90 pollution on an area of around 40 
km[.sup]2[/] within the territory of the East Ural 
radioactive track reaches as high as 2,000 c/km[.sup]2[/], 
the maximum level of pollution in the floodplain of the upper 
reaches of the Techa River is 200 mc/km[.sup]2[/] for 
strontium-90 and 400 mc/km[.sup]2[/] for cesium-137. 
Territories polluted by cesium-137, including the floodplain of 
the Techa River above the point where it flows into the Iset 
River, are illustrated in Figure 1.9.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-49A>           Figure 1.9.2. Density of Cesium-137 </FIG>



  There is virtually no radioactive pollution of the Tom River 
floodplain outside the safety zone of the Siberian Chemical 
Combine. 
  As a result of the earlier dumping of liquid radioactive 
waste into the Yenisey River by the Krasnoyarsk Mineral Chemical 
Combine, some sections of the floodplain were still polluted in 
1992 at a rate of 20-30 mc/m[.sup]2[/] for hundreds of 
kilometers downstream. 
  Levels of soil pollution by cesium-137 in Orenburg Oblast 
did 
not exceed 0.1 c/km[.sup]2[/] and the rate directly in the 
epicenter of the 1954 nuclear explosion is 1.5 c/km[.sup]2[/]. 
  In Altay Kray, where the first Soviet nuclear test of 29 
August 1949 was responsible for 80 percent of the artificial 
radionuclide precipitate, the average rate of pollution by 
cesium-137 was 0.1-0.2 c/km[.sup]2[/]. There are two spots in 
the southwest of the kray with a rate of 0.2-0.5 
c/km[.sup]2[/]. 
  No pollution of the continental portion of the European 
north 
from the nuclear tests on the Novaya Zemlya test site has been 
detected, but there are localized zones on the island with 
higher levels of radioactivity. The whole site of 90,200 
km[.sup]2[/] requires scrupulous monitoring. 
  Localized pollution has been recorded in some sections of 
the 
Orenburg and Astrakhan gas condensate deposits near the entrance 
to the site of the underground nuclear explosions conducted for 
peaceful purposes in 1965-1987. 
  Between 1974 and 1992, 847 zones of localized and extended 
radioactive pollution were discovered by the Radon Association 
in conjunction with other organizations in Moscow. Approximately 
50 percent were found in the city's southern and eastern 
districts. Most of these were pockets of soil containing 
radon-226 and cesium-137 (612 zones), objects polluted by 
radioactive substances (172 zones), and sources of ionizing 
radiation (63 zones). In 1992 alone, 60 of these zones were 
found within the city limits and 22 were found in the oblast. 
  Readings of constantly monitored radiation parameters in the 
Moscow environment are from one to ten times as high as 
background readings (in the sparsely populated north of Moscow 
Oblast), but they do not exceed public health standards. Zones 
of radioactive pollution which were discovered and then 
neutralized were the only exception. The redistribution of 
radionuclides has been observed: the reduction of radioactive 
aerosol precipitate and of concentrations in the atmosphere and 
the accumulation of radionuclides in the snow cover, bottom 
sediment, and soil. Cesium-137, strontium-90, kalium-40, and 
short-lived products of the decay of radioactive series have 
been detected. 
  The territorial reading of the exposure dose of 
gamma-radiation was higher than background readings in regions 
contaminated by the Chernobyl and Kyshtym accidents and also in 
some locations of mineral extraction and processing and 
localized spots of accidental pollution. 
  In 1992 organizations of Roskomnedra found sites of 
radioactive pollution in 58 cities and industrial centers in the 
Russian Federation. They discovered 517 pockets of radioactive 
pollution, including 129 with a maximum effective dose (MED) of 
gamma-radiation exceeding 1,000 mr/hr. In addition, 401 pockets 
of radioactive pollution connected with the Chernobyl accident 
were found in the city of Penza. 
  Inspections of juvenile academic institutions revealed more 
than 700 objects emitting high levels of radioactivity with an 
MED of up to 0.5 r/hr. 
  According to Mintopenergo [RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy] 
data, the accumulation of significant quantities of natural 
radionuclides (NRN) is possible in the locations of mineral 
extraction and processing, combining with background levels to 
create a hazard. In particular, this applies to coal mines and 
oil drilling sites. The level of gamma-radiation around 106 of 
the 855 inspected wells on oilfields in Stavropol Kray ranged 
from 200 to 1,750 mcr/hr. This was due to deposits of radium and 
thorium salts that were carried to the surface in the excess 
drilling fluid. Polluted production equipment, particularly the 
used pipe in storage, had radiation readings of 3,000 mcr/hr. 
Pipes with a reading of 200-300 mcr/hr were found in use as 
fencing, awnings, and so forth in virtually all of the surveyed 
spots in Neftekumskiy Rayon. 
  In the regions surrounding TES's and GRES's operating on 
coals with high radioactivity levels, ash heaps and the ash 
ejected through smokestacks can cause the accumulation of NRN in 
the soil. When the dust settles for a long time (50-100 years), 
the specific radioactivity of the soil within 50-100 kilometers 
of the TES flues could be two or three times the background 
levels. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of Water Systems </H5>
  The average concentration of radionuclides in the water of 
Russia's rivers in 1992 was the same as in 1991. The 
concentration of strontium-90 was approximately 0.3x10-12 c/l, 
which was below the cumulative tolerance dose by three orders of 
magnitude--400x10-12 c/l for drinking water. The average 
concentration of tritium in the main rivers of Russia was within 
the range of (70-265)x10-12 c/l. 
  The concentrations of cesium-137 and strontium-90 in the 
rivers flowing through Bryansk, Tula, and Kaluga oblasts were 
below the VDU-91 (temporary allowable level) by two orders of 
magnitude (500x10-12 and 100x10-12 c/l respectively). Maximum 
levels of pollution of underground sources of water by 
strontium-90 below the VDU-91 by three orders of magnitude, and 
the maximum level of cesium-137 was one-seventieth of the 
VDU-91. The content of strontium-90 in forest streams in Bryansk 
Oblast can rise as high as 50x10-12 c/l (0.5 times the VDU-91). 
  A strontium-90 discharge of 1.8 times the allowable limit in 
one of the outlets to the Techa River was recorded at the Mayak 
Production Association in 1992 (during the year the 
concentration in the monitored channel was 2-7 times the limit). 
The concentration of strontium-90 in the Techa River was within 
the range of 2.7-5.4x10-10 c/l and exceeded the allowable 
concentration (3x10-10 c/l) for up to 30 kilometers downstream 
from the levee of the last industrial tank. 
  The concentration of strontium-90 in the water of the Iset 
River below the Techa estuary was only one-third or one-fourth 
as high as in the Techa River. 
  The presence of surface reservoirs--storage tanks of liquid 
waste--at the Mayak Production Association causes the migration 
of substances to the water table and underground springs. A 
lenticle of polluted sewage with a capacity of around 4 million 
m[.sup]3[/] and an area of just under 10 km[.sup]2[/] has 
formed under Lake Karachay. The rate of spatial migration by 
polluted underground water can be 80 meters a year. There is the 
danger that this water could penetrate other water-bearing 
structures and enter the surface water. 
  The dumping of sewage containing phosphorus-32 in 1.14 times 
the limit was recorded at the Siberian Chemical Combine (the 
total activity of waste exceeding discharge limits was 157 c). 
Furthermore, the average annual concentration of this 
radionuclide in the monitored channel of the Tom River and the 
closest point of water use was 2.9 times the allowable 
concentration. The concentration of short-lived radioisotopes in 
the Tom River was below the detectable level, and the 
concentration of long-lived radioisotopes was the same as the 
global background. 
  The sewage of the Mineral Chemical Combine (in Krasnoyarsk) 
did not exceed the allowable concentrations in the control 
channel of the Yenisey River in 1992. 
  The average level of strontium-90 pollution in the seas was 
the same as in 1991. The maximum concentration of this 
radioisotope was recorded in the Azov Sea (0.9x10-12 c/l), and 
the minimum was found near the Pacific coastline of Russia 
(0.07-0.17)x10-12 c/l. 
<H5>  Radioactive Waste </H5>
  The management and decontamination of radioactive waste (RW) 
constitute an urgent problem at this time. The main sources of 
this waste are enterprises of nuclear power engineering and the 
defense industry. 
  The disposal of radioactive waste takes precedence over 
other 
ecological problems for the defense complex, because existing 
capacities, the size of storage facilities, and the reliability 
of storage are limited, and the construction of new facilities 
would entail colossal technical and material expenditures. The 
plans for the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear power 
engineering equipment have not been coordinated sufficiently 
with the possibilities for the safe storage and disposal of the 
resulting radioactive waste. 
  Radioactive waste with total activity of 1.7 billion curies 
has accumulated at enterprises of Atomenergo. The waste is kept 
in 227 storage facilities: 81 are closed and 146 are still in 
operation. An experimental industrial unit for the glazing of 
hot waste began operating at the Mayak Production Association in 
1992. More than 110 million curies of radionuclides were encased 
in phosphate glass. 
  Industrial bituminization units were still operating at the 
Leningrad and Kalinin AES's. By the beginning of 1993, more than 
18,000 m[.sup]3[/] of radioactive concentrates had been 
solidified. 
  Due to the absence of the necessary technical equipment for 
the processing of RW in the country in general and the Navy in 
particular, the radioactive waste of nuclear-powered submarines 
and surface ships was dumped in the seas from 1960 to 1992, but 
the volume decreased last year. In 1992, 3066 m[.sup]3[/] of 
liquid RW with activity of 18 c was dumped in the Northern seas, 
and 3,580 m[.sup]3[/] of liquid waste with activity of 10.2 c 
and 2,740 m[.sup]3[/] of solid RW with activity of 37 c were 
dumped in the Far Eastern seas. 
<H5>  1.10. Noise and Electromagnetic Radiation </H5>
  The intolerable level of noise pollution will have a variety 
of adverse effects on public health. 
  The average noise level on highways in big cities like 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, Magnitogorsk, and Yekaterinburg 
was 73-83 dB(A), and the maximum level was 90-95. Furthermore, 
the noise level in homes near the highways can be as high as 
62-77 dB(A), which is far in excess of public health 
standards--40dB(A) for daytime and 30dB(A) for 
nighttime--approaching the noise level in production. 
  Changes in the functional state of the auditory analyzer and 
of the nervous and cardiovascular systems have been recorded in 
people living near these highways. Children studying in 
classrooms with a penetrating noise level exceeding 45 dB(A) 
suffer from diminished auditory sensitivity, fatigue, and 
headaches. 
  Physiological studies of hemodynamics in people living near 
the Bykovo (Moscow) and Adler airports indicated that only 62 
percent of the individuals examined had normal blood pressure 
readings for their ages. The complaints of individuals and 
objective data revealed that the subjects of the studies were 
developing functional disorders of the central nervous system, 
the cardiovascular system, and the acoustic organ, taking the 
form of neurasthenia, near-neurotic states, abnormal blood 
pressure readings, stenocardia, and diminished auditory 
sensitivity. 
  Physical examinations of children in the primary grades in 
neighborhoods near the Vnukovo and Astrakhan airports revealed 
the reduction of intellectual capacity by 10-46 percent, an 
increase of 6-13 percent in the rate of respiratory disease, and 
an increase of 26-27 percent in disorders of the nervous system. 
  Mass construction on vacant lots near the runways of 
airports 
in various cities, such as Mineralnyye Vody, Khabarovsk, 
Komsomolsk, Amur, and several others, has reduced or eliminated 
the safety zones around them, and this has increased the zones 
of acoustic discomfort. Noise levels in homes within a radius of 
5-10 km from the outer limits of airports can be as high as 
90-97 dB(A) if the windows are open and 82-99 dB(A) if they are 
closed. 
  The situation is similar with respect to the electromagnetic 
pollution of the environment. According to studies and expert 
appraisals, special radio centers, communication lines, radio 
broadcasting equipment, and radar stations produced this kind of 
pollution in amounts far in excess of public health standards in 
residential communities. 
  High levels of electromagnetic radiation from military 
installations were recorded in several regions (the Republic of 
Mari El and Krasnodar and Stavropol krays). 
  In the rural community of Konosha in Arkhangelsk Oblast, for 
example, located 600 meters from an air defense complex, the 
current density in homes was 17.5 times the maximum allowable 
level (MAL). This contributed to functional disorders of the 
central nervous system and the circulatory system and changes in 
the functional state of the thyroid gland and immune system. 
  According to experts, the deterioration of sanitary and 
hygienic conditions can be expected in the near future, along 
with an increase in the number of people suffering from 
anthropogenic acoustic and electromagnetic disturbances of 
relatively high levels. This is connected with the loss of 
control over the levels of these disturbances, the use of 
sanitary protective zones for construction, the inadequate 
volume of repairs on railroads and at enterprises, the absence 
of strict control over the technical state of motor vehicles, 
the sharp cuts in funding for scientific and 
scientific-technical research projects, and a corresponding 
reduction in the number of researchers, who once conducted 
productive studies of the public health aspects of acoustic and 
electromagnetic influences and who had begun assessing the 
ecological dangers of the effects of these factors on natural 
elements and systems of the environment. 
<H5>  1.11. Environmental Pollution by Highly Hazardous Substances </H5>
  Dioxin, furan: 
  The development of dioxin-hazardous production units in 
several Russian cities and the use of herbicides in the zones of 
intensive rice farming in the Kuban, the lower Volga, the Far 
East, and the cis-Azov zone are creating a genuine threat of 
dioxin pollution. When certain localized sources of dioxin 
hazards were inspected from 1988 to 1992, dioxin pollution was 
found in products, sewage, emissions, the soil, and the air on 
the grounds of several enterprises and in nearby areas. 
  When the content of polychlor dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and 
dibenzofuran (PCDF) in the surface water of Ufa, Chapayevsk, 
Baykalsk, Kondrovo, Kaliningrad, and Dzerzhinsk was measured, 
concentrations exceeding the limit were found near water supply 
networks in Ufa (1.2 times the limit), Chapayevsk (4.1 times), 
and Kondrovo (10.5 times). 
  Dioxins in concentrations exceeding the presumed safe level 
of exposure (PSLE) in the soil on the grounds of plants were 
found in Ufa (up to 160 times the PSLE), Chapayevsk (up to 75 
times), and Dzerzhinsk (up to 1.4 times). In some places in 
Chapayevsk the content of dioxin in the soil exceeded 2,000 
times the PSLE, and the content in the air was almost 7 times 
the PSLE. 
  Benzpyrene: 
  In 1992 the average annual concentrations of BP in most of 
Russia's cities had declined by as much as 70 percent in 
relation to the level at the start of the decade of 
observations, and the average for Russia was 3.3 times the MAC 
in the report year. 
  The only exceptions were Blagoveshchensk, Bratsk, Irkutsk, 
Iskitim, Ulan-Ude, and Chita, where air pollution by BP 
increased (10-20 times the MAC). 
  In some cities the content of BP in the air ranged from 0.1 
to 1.5 times the MAC (Volzhskiy, Voskresensk, Dzerzhinsk, Kursk, 
Norilsk, Orsk, Gorki Leninskiye, Kirishi, Klin, Kovdor, 
Naberezhnyye Chelny, Nakhodka, Severodvinsk, Syzran, Yasnaya 
Polyana). 
<H5>  1.12. Biological Pollution </H5>
  Biological pollution resulting from the accidental 
introduction of animals, plants, and microorganisms into the 
environment can inflict perceptible damage on the vitality of 
existing ecosystems. 
  In recent years the ichthyofauna of the Azov and Black seas 
has suffered from the mnemyopsis leydii brought here 
inadvertently from the United States in ballast fluid. Its mass 
proliferation in the Azov Sea in 1991-92 reduced the quantity of 
plankton to 0.04 mg/m[.sup]3[/], which is below the earlier 
average by a factor of almost 10,000. Changes in the trophic 
structure of pelagian biocenosis have reduced stocks of 
anchovies and sardines dramatically by depriving them of their 
food base. According to FAO estimates, the losses of commercial 
fish in the Azov Sea will be equivalent to 40-60 million U.S. 
dollars a year. 
  The Rapana bezoar in the Black Sea was one of the reasons 
for 
the disappearance of the Gudauta oyster beds. 
  Similar phenomena have been observed in fresh-water basins. 
When sandre and bream settled in the Obskaya inlet, they moved 
to the lower reaches of the Ob River, where they are inflicting 
considerable damage by eating the roe and fry of the river sig. 
  The accidental migration of carp to the small steppe lakes 
of 
West Siberia is reducing the yield of fish from these lakes by 
30-80 percent because the carp are eating most of the minnow roe 
and fry. 
  Insects brought in by accident are frequently agricultural 
pests. They include the American white moth, a pest to mulberry, 
fruit, and decorative trees and shrubs, the potato moth, and the 
Capri beetle--the most dangerous pest to food supplies. 
  The distribution of accidental species of insects in the 
Russian Federation in 1992 was the following: 
  Colorado beetle--on an area of 2.46 million hectares (in 58 
krays, oblasts, and republics); 
  North American white moth--108,000 hectares; 
  Phylloxera--94,000 hectares; 
  San Jose scale--131,000 hectares. 
  Ubiquitous foreign species are taken off the quarantine 
list, 
and after this happens it is no longer possible to isolate and 
evaluate the damage caused by each separate species. 
  Most of the foreign insects that have invaded Russian 
territory are not being monitored. There are no forecasts of the 
probability of new accidental species and the degree of the 
consequent damage. In 1992 the Plant Quarantine Service 
monitored 11 species of insects causing obvious damage in 
extensive areas of the Russian Federation, and 13 species with 
the same status in neighboring countries. Not one of the species 
that entered this country and settled here has been eliminated. 
The areas of proliferation of all of the quarantine species 
without exception are increasing each year. 
  The habitats and numbers of foreign species of arthropods 
are 
growing, and they are causing perceptible harm to human health. 
One species of tick, the Ornithonyssus bacoti, has been found in 
homes in the Donbass in recent years. It is a carrier of 
rickettsialpox. It usually feeds on sinanthropic rodents, but it 
also attacks man, and its bites cause dermatitis. A study of 
cases of dermatitis in Moscow revealed the presence of the tick 
in the capital. Eighty zones of tick-borne dermatitis were 
recorded in Moscow between February 1990 and February 1993 and 
the tick itself was found. 
  Southern species of ants are more common in Russian cities 
now. In addition to the red house ants, which can be found 
anywhere in the capital, Hypoponeva Eduardi Forel from the 
Mediterranean countries and the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus 
and Hasins Alienus Foster, which is most commonly found in the 
South, can now be seen in heated buildings in Moscow. 
  In Moscow the classic beetle roach has been joined by the 
American cockroach (Periplaneta americana L.) and some exotic 
species--the Nanphoeta cinerea Olivier and a resident of warmer 
climes with a resemblance to the red cockroach, Supella 
supellectilinum Serv. The latter's habitat is in the Tropics and 
Subtropics, but it has also been found in Istanbul, Teheran, and 
Paris. 
  The number of Culex piens molertus mosquitoes is still 
rising 
in Moscow. Whereas mosquito abatement projects were conducted on 
an area of 1,400 m[.sup]2[/] in 1972, the figure was 926,000 
m[.sup]2[/] in 1992. 
  The Smirnov beetle (Altagenus smirnovi Zhant) from Kenya has 
settled down in Russia and is damaging woolen, fur, and leather 
goods in homes, warehouses, and fur factories. 
  Because of the danger of the pollution of the environment 
with the waste of enterprises engaged in microbiological 
synthesis, air quality is monitored carefully in the locations 
of enterprises producing protein-vitamin concentrates (BVK)--the 
Kirishi Biochemical Plant, the Blagoveshchensk Biochemical 
Combine, and the Kstovo, Angarsk, and Svetloyarsk BVK plants. No 
BVK particulate was found in 1992 in the industrial zone of 
industrial zone of Kirishi, Kstovo, Angarsk, and Blagoveshchensk 
or in the emissions of the Angarsk BVK plant. Concentrations of 
BVK dust in some samples of the particulate from the Kirishi 
Biochemical Plant did not exceed public health standards. 
Concentrations of BVK dust in the industrial zone of the Svetlyy 
Yar worker's settlement did not exceed the limit. 
  The rate of illness with bronchial asthma, asthmatic 
bronchitis, and skin allergies did not exceed the average. 
<H6>  Section 2. Natural Territories Under Special Protection </H6>
  At a time of economic and political instability, the 
inadequate enforcement of environmental laws, and the dramatic 
deterioration of ecological conditions in many parts of the 
country, protected natural territories (PNT) have a much more 
important role to play in maintaining the ecological balance and 
protecting the natural potential of Russian territories. 
  The main categories (or types) of PNT in the Russian 
Federation are state nature preserves, including biosphere 
preserves, national parks, and federal, republic, and regional 
sanctuaries. 
  The maintenance and development of the PNT network is a 
priority of RF state ecological policy. 
<H3>  2.1. State Nature Preserves, National Parks, State 
Sanctuaries, and Natural Monuments </H3>
  The total area of Russia's nature preserves is 20.4 million* 
hectares, or around 1.2 percent* of the territory of the Russian 
Federation. 
  On 31 December 1992 there were 79* nature preserves in 
Russia: 71* maintained by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, 4* 
maintained by the Russian Academy of Sciences, 2* in the Russian 
Ministry of Science network, 1* belonging to forestry agencies, 
and 1* belonging to the Russian Ministry of Defense. 
  Figure 2.1.1 illustrates the proportional amount of 
protected 
territory in the total area of territorial-administrative units 
of the Russian Federation. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-53A>           Figure 2.1.1. Area of Protected </FIG>



  Three new state nature preserves were established in Russia 
in 1992. 
  ``Pasvik'' was established in Murmansk Oblast (total area of 
14,586 ha) to protect the northern pine forests and valuable 
wetlands and to conduct comprehensive environmental monitoring. 
The preserve is located in direct proximity to Norway, and its 
northern and western boundaries follow the channel of the Paz 
River, marking the state border of the Russian Federation. The 
preserve was founded with the active participation of Norwegian 
specialists and is supposed to become the Russian part of the 
international Russian-Norwegian ``Fjervann-Pasvik'' reservation 
in the future. 
  The ``Dzherginskiy'' preserve was established in the 
Republic 
of Buryatia (total area of 237,806 ha) to preserve and study the 
characteristic and unique ecosystems of the Lake Baykal basin. 
It is located in Buryatia's Kurumkanskiy Rayon in the upper 
reaches of the Barguzin River, including the summit of the Ikat 
range, in locations inhabited by the Evenki people, on whose 
initiative it was established. 
  The ``Kaluzhskiye zaseki'' preserve was established in 
Ulyanovskiy Rayon in Kaluga Oblast (total area of 18,533 ha) to 
protect and study unique sections of forest ecosystems in the 
broad-leaved forests of the ETR. The territory of the preserve 
is part of the oldest protected Russian territory (mentioned in 
chronicles as early as the 9th and 10th centuries), with a large 
impenetrable group of broad-leaved forests. The territory of the 
preserve was exposed to radioactive pollution as a result of the 
accident at the Chernobyl AES and could serve as the site of 
observations of the state of the environment under high levels 
of radiation. 
  Some preserves were enlarged in 1992, adding 3,000* hectares 
to the Central Forest Preserve in Tver Oblast, 17,000* hectares 
to the Caucasus Preserve in the Adyge Republic, 43,000* hectares 
to the Kronotskiy Preserve in Kamchatka Oblast, 111,000* 
hectares to the Barguzin Preserve in the Republic of Buryatia, 
and so forth. 
  Therefore, the area of nature preserves was augmented by a 
total of 496,000* hectares in 1992, including new preserves with 
a combined area of 271,000* hectares and the enlargement of 
existing preserves by 225,000* hectares. 
  Figure 2.1.2 illustrates the locations of the new state 
preserves and national parks established in 1991-92. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-54A>           Figure 2.1.2. Locations of Protected </FIG>



  In 1992 preparations were made for the creation of 11 new 
nature preserves, scheduled for completion in 1993-94. In the 
case of some, surveys were completed, plans were drawn up, and 
the appropriate decisions were made by regional agencies of the 
executive branch of government. These are the ``Ubsunurskaya 
kotlovina'' (or ``Ubsunur'') preserve in the Tuva Republic, the 
``Konovatskiy,'' ``Gydanskiy,'' and ``Yamalskiy'' preserves in 
the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in Tyumen Oblast, and the 
``Koryakskiy'' preserve in the north of Kamchatka Oblast. 
  The work on the Rostov Steppe Preserve in Rostov Oblast, the 
Suburban Moscow Preserve extending into three rayons of Moscow 
Oblast, and the Commodore Preserve on the archipelago of the 
same name in Kamchatka Oblast reached the final stages. 
  Project plans were drawn up for the Great Arctic Preserve, 
with a total area of around 5 million hectares in the north of 
the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug in Krasnoyarsk Kray and the North 
Astrakhan Preserve in Astrakhan Oblast. 
  Planning and research projects were launched in Leningrad 
Oblast for the establishment of a preserve in the eastern part 
of the Gulf of Finland, which will become part of a large 
international Russian-Finnish reservation. 
  In addition to the creation of new preserves, there were 
plans for the enlargement of existing ones, including the 
enlargement of the ``Basegi,'' ``Central Chernozem,'' and 
``Lazovskiy'' preserves. 
  State preserves have the status of environmental research 
organizations and have been conducting long-term studies for 
more than 60 years as part of the ``Nature Chronicle'' program. 
This research serves as the basis for the organization of 
ecological monitoring and control. Botanical and zoological 
research projects are conducted in the preserves, 
mini-laboratories are set up for the quick analysis of soil, 
water, and air samples, and weather bases and stations are 
operating here. 
  The 16 biosphere preserves occupy a special place among 
Russia's preserves. They are part of the UNESCO global network 
of biosphere preserves. Comprehensive background monitoring 
stations in six of them are recording data on the chemical 
pollution of typical preserve ecosystems. 
  Rare species of animals are kept, studied, and bred in 
nurseries in some preserves for the protection of exceptionally 
valuable genetic stock. Nurseries in the Oka Preserve house 
bison, crane, and birds of prey. The central bison nursery is in 
the Cis-Oka Terrace Preserve. There are animal nurseries in the 
Voronezh, Darwin, and Khingan preserves. 
  The main difficulties in the development of scientific 
research in the preserves stem from the shortage of material and 
technical equipment. The absence of the necessary laboratory 
facilities, equipped with modern computers and measuring 
instruments, is complicating the organization of in-depth 
research. 
  In recent years there have been more frequent cases of the 
use of protected territories for economic activity. Sovkhozes 
located near the Altay Preserve in the Tuva and Gorno-Altay 
republics repeatedly used protected territories as grazing land 
for cattle, sheep, and goats. Furthermore the Altay Republic 
Government has demanded that some parts of the preserve on the 
shore of Lake Teletsk be turned over to the Chulyshmanskiy 
Sovkhoz for use as goat pastures. 
  On 20 May 1992 the Supreme Council of the Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic approved the earlier decision of that republic's 
Cabinet of Ministers on the appropriation of 1,142 hectares of 
land from the Kabardino-Balkar Preserve, including 642 hectares 
of unique alpine forest, which will cause irreparable harm to 
the preserve's ecosystems. 
  In some cases, local governments have considered the closure 
of preserves for immediate economic interests. The Ayano-Mayskiy 
rayon council, for example, is demanding the closure of the 
Dzhugdzhurskiy Preserve in Khabarovsk Kray, and officials on 
Kunashir Island (Southern Kurils) have questioned the 
advisability of the continued functioning of the ``Kurilskiy'' 
preserve. 
  The protection of state preserves is the responsibility of a 
special board of inspectors with a staff of around 1,600. 
  In 1992 the inspectors wrote up 2,125 reports, including 629 
on the unauthorized occupation of land, 531 on the poaching of 
fish and other aquatic flora and fauna, 436 on traffic 
violations, 221 on illegal hunting, 100 on illegal hay-mowing 
and livestock pasturing, 96 on unauthorized felling, 37 on 
violations of fire safety regulations in forests, and so forth, 
and apprehended 1,134 offenders. They investigated the illegal 
shooting (or trapping) of 47 ungulates, 3 bears, 2 tigers, and 
so forth. 
  They confiscated 17 rifles, 66 shotguns, 306 nets, 810 
traps, 
993 kilograms of fish, and 500 kilograms of wild plants. Law 
enforcement agencies instituted criminal proceedings in 35 of 
these cases. 
  The treatment of the preserves by state planning and finance 
agencies is clearly inconsistent with their socioeconomic and 
scientific significance. 
  The Ministry of Finance allocations for the maintenance of 
preserves were woefully inadequate. In 1992, for example, the 
amount required for the maintenance of the preserves was 770 
million rubles, but allocations were limited to 394.8 million 
rubles. This was enough only for the bare minimum of basic 
functions. The preserves needed 272 million rubles in capital 
investments for the development of their material and technical 
base, but the amount extended was only 121.3 million. 
  All of the work involved in the establishment of new 
protected natural territories is financed by federal and 
regional extrabudgetary ecological funds. New preserves suffer 
difficulties because the meager allocations preclude the 
construction or leasing of housing for their personnel, 
buildings for offices, public facilities, and laboratories and 
the purchase of expensive equipment, supplies, weapons, 
ammunition, etc. 
  Payment for airborne forest protection services was late and 
extremely limited in 1992, as a result of which the network of 
preserves was not ready for the fire season. Fires which were 
not detected in time caused serious damage. The continuation of 
this kind of funding in coming years could destroy the network 
of Russian preserves, and this will have an irreparable negative 
impact on environmental quality. 
<H5>  National Parks </H5>
  The national parks are a type of territorial nature preserve 
that did not exist in Russia in the past. They are intended for 
use for conservation, recreational, educational, scientific, and 
cultural purposes and generally include unique natural objects, 
landscapes, historical monuments, and other natural wonders. 
Most of the area of these parks is taken up by forests and 
bodies of water, but the preservation of the integrity of the 
natural complex has sometimes required the inclusion of other 
territories in the parks, as well as historical-cultural, 
memorial, and botanical territories, including natural museums. 
  The first national parks in Russia were established in 1983 
(the ``Sochinskiy'' on the Black Sea coast and the ``Losinyy 
ostrov'' park in the city and oblast of Moscow). By the end of 
1992 Russia already had 22 national parks with a total area of 
more than 4.4 million hectares. Five parks (with an area of 
546,800 hectares) were established in 1992. 
  All of the national parks but two (``Losinyy ostrov'' and 
``Pereslavskiy'') are managed by the Federal Forest Service. 
  A standard statute on Russia's national parks, defining the 
procedures for their organization and the rules of their 
management and operation, was drafted in 1992. 
  The main economic instrument for the management of national 
parks is direct budget financing. Allocations for the 
maintenance of these establishments in 1992 were projected at 
15.5 million rubles in 1992--i.e., an average of 4 rubles per 
hectare of protected territory--and the amount paid in 1992 was 
142 million, or 35 rubles per hectare, but in the new prices. 
National parks can strengthen their financial position, however, 
by offering the use of their territory for recreational 
purposes. The main prerequisite is the existence of a developed 
infrastructure in the parks, connected with specific forms of 
public services requiring large initial investments, including 
investments financed by budget allocations. 
  The creation of national parks entails the appropriation of 
land, forest, and water resources and the cessation of 
untraditional forms of resource use within their territory, 
which is frequently resisted fiercely by economic structures. 
  Regrettably, in the last 10 years, from the time the system 
of national parks began to be organized to the present, the 
processes of establishment have not been completed in a single 
park. The biggest problems are connected with land requisitions. 
It can take years to draw up the general plans, coordinate them, 
and put together a staff of specialists. Budget funding and 
material and technical supplies are clearly inadequate. 
Financing operations and the hiring of personnel for the main 
areas of functional activity are conducted without any clear 
priorities. 
  National parks often fall victim to illegal economic 
expansion, primarily by local government agencies. 
  The lack of legal protection for the national parks is the 
reason for the continuation of practices injuring their natural 
complexes: the extraction of building materials (``Samarskaya 
luka''), the detachment of parcels of land (the 
``Pribaykalskiy'' and ``Losinyy ostrov'' parks), the grazing of 
livestock and application of herbicides (``Bashkiria''), and the 
use of the land for orchards, gardens, and garages 
(``Sochinskiy,'' ``Losinyy ostrov,'' and others). 
  A comprehensive performance evaluation of the ``Losinyy 
ostrov'' park by the Russian Ministry of Ecology in 1992, for 
example, revealed that environmental laws and the forest and 
land codes were virtually unenforced in the park. There were 
numerous cases of the failure to take action against individuals 
using park lands and protected zones for vacation homes, 
gardens, garages, and timber felling. Most of the enterprises on 
the grounds of the park and its protected zone are not equipped 
with effective waste treatment plants. The state of affairs in 
the park, its organizational structure, its administrative and 
economic dependence on the Moscow Municipal Forest Park 
Administration, and its maintenance by the Moscow Municipal 
Planning and Engineering Administration are inconsistent with 
its significance, its status, and the purpose and goals of its 
creation. In general, the commission found that the park's 
performance had been unsatisfactory since the time of its 
establishment. The park still does not have a definite 
development strategy, an approved general plan, or even a 
document certifying its right to use the land, legal 
certification of the boundaries of its protected zone, and many 
other legislative instruments regulating the relations between 
the park administration and the many individuals make use of its 
territory. All of this is against the interests of the park 
because it limits its development to the confines of ordinary 
forest parks. 
  Difficulties similar to those suffered by ``Losinyy ostrov'' 
were also encountered in the creation of the ``Samarskaya luka'' 
national park, the establishment of which began in 1984 and has 
not been completed yet. Part of the park's territory was 
appropriated for the extraction of clay and local building 
materials with the support of the Samara Oblast corps of 
deputies. The minor soviet of the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet of 
People's Deputies arranged for the revision of the boundaries of 
the ``Pribaykalskiy'' National Park, despite the fact that this 
park is under exclusive federal jurisdiction. 
<H5>  State Wildlife Sanctuaries </H5>
  Sanctuaries are natural complexes of conservation, 
ecological, and aesthetic value and are intended for the 
preservation, reproduction, and restoration of specific types of 
natural resources (or objects) in combination with the limited, 
controlled, and efficient use of others. The rules of 
sanctuaries are stipulated in individual statutes by agreement 
with the users of the land. A standard statute on state wildlife 
sanctuaries in the Russian Federation was approved in 1992. 
  Russia has more than 1,500 sanctuaries, including 71 federal 
sanctuaries on an area of over 56 million hectares, representing 
more than 3 percent of the country's territory. Around 200 are 
landscape sanctuaries. 
  Most of the sanctuaries are in the Main Hunting 
Administration network-- around 1,000 sanctuaries with an area 
of 49.7 million hectares. Their security service is extremely 
limited--an average of one or two rangers per sanctuary. 
  Supplementing the network of preserves and national parks, 
and adjacent to them in many cases, the sanctuaries do much to 
increase their legal representation. Seven sanctuaries 
(``Verkhne-Kondinskiy,'' ``Yeloguyskiy,'' ``Kabanskiy,'' 
``Tsasucheyskiy bor,'' ``Yuzhno-Kamchatskiy,'' ``Yuzhnyye 
Kurily,'' and ``Tseyskiy'') are on the grounds of nature 
preserves and are under the jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry 
of Ecology. Others will be added to this list in the future. The 
``Nature Chronicle'' is kept each year in the republic 
sanctuaries, just as it is in the preserves. 
Scientific-procedural backing for the activities of sanctuaries 
was provided by the Central Scientific Research Laboratory of 
the Russian Federation Main Hunting Administration and the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  In contrast to other protected natural territories, the 
network of state sanctuaries is an extremely dynamic and mobile 
form of protection. The many years of experience in working with 
the sanctuaries have revealed that their potential to protect 
wildlife is far from exhausted. There is the real possibility of 
enhancing the effectiveness of these protective entities 
considerably by supplementing RF legislation with several 
sections on liability for violations of the rules of sanctuaries 
and by instituting supplementary state statistical reports. 
<H5>  Natural Monuments </H5>
  Unique natural objects requiring special state protection 
and 
having features of scientific, historical, and 
ecological-educational value can be declared federal or local 
natural monuments and be withdrawn completely from economic use. 
  According to the latest inventory of state forest resources, 
0.0003 percent of Russia's territory is categorized as natural 
monuments, which is 97,300 hectares more than in 1983. 
  Natural monuments are not independent juridical persons. The 
enforcement of the rules of their protection and use is the 
responsibility of the institutions owning the land where they 
are located. The observance of these rules is overseen by state 
environmental agencies. 
  Forest preserves, natural monuments, and forests of 
scientific or historical significance are usually examples of 
typical landscapes and the habitat of rare and valuable plants 
and often perform the functions of local micro-preserves or even 
republic preserves in some cases. 
  Natural monuments are more vulnerable to anthropogenic 
influences because of their smaller area in comparison with 
other protected territories and because of their lack of 
protective buffer zones. Violations of the rules of natural 
monuments have been recorded everywhere: poaching, illegal 
felling, and unsupervised forms of recreation. As a result, up 
to 25 percent of the area of natural monuments is experiencing 
excessive anthropogenic influences that are degrading natural 
complexes and objects. 
  A standard statute on natural monuments in the Russian 
Federation was approved in 1992 for the purpose of improving the 
legal bases of their operation. 
<H5>  Natural Museums </H5>
  Natural museums, which include memorial-historical and 
literary museums, historical dwellings, open-air museums, and 
others, occupy a special position among the protected natural 
territories. 
  The area of the natural museums ranges from a few hectares 
(the Borodino State Natural Museum of Military History--11 
hectares) to tens of thousands of hectares (the Sholokhov 
Natural Museum in Rostov Oblast--28,000 hectares). Not all of 
them have official protective zones. 
  Up to the present time there have been no statutes 
regulating 
their functions, organizational principles, and rules of land 
use and ownership. There are no ecologists on the staffs of 
these organizations, and there is no system of monitoring and 
preventive maintenance. All of this leads to critical ecological 
situations on the grounds of the natural museums. A good example 
is the Yasnaya Polyana museum-preserve, where the old park has 
suffered considerable damage from the harmful emissions of the 
nearby Azot Production Association in Shchekino. The Shchelykovo 
Natural Museum in Kostroma Oblast and others are encountering 
similar problems. 
  Although the ecological conditions of the Borodino State 
Natural Museum of Military History are good in general, the 
misuse of the land has disrupted hydrological processes and 
caused irreversible changes in the appearance of the historical 
landscape. Its preservation will require a standard program of 
land use on this territory, which now belongs to eight different 
organizations. 
  The protected natural territories have certain problems in 
common: the weak legal and procedural base, unsatisfactory 
methods of keeping records and evaluating the state of existing 
objects, and the absence of a comprehensive research program. 
<H5>  2.2. Health Resorts and Therapeutic Treatment Zones </H5>
  The territorial distribution of the country's resort and 
therapeutic treatment zones is not uniform (Table 2.2.1). 


Table 2.2.1. Health Resorts and Therapeutic Treatment Zones 

Economic region                  Number of resorts      Type of therapy

  The North Caucasus and Kalmykia will be of special 
importance 
in the further development of therapeutic resources, although 
the favorable landscape and climate in many parts of the country 
and the presence of known and projected reserves of mineral 
springs and therapeutic muds could turn local spas into resort 
complexes. The current demand for resort therapy is satisfied by 
no more than 10 percent for adults and 6 percent for children. 
  Health resorts and vacation establishments belong to 
different ministries and departments, including the RF 
Federation of Independent Trade Unions, which has been 
monitoring the state of the environment and natural resources of 
resort zones for many years. 
  In 1992 trade unions owned 455 health resorts with 
accommodations for 213,100 guests. They served 2.6 million 
people (4.2 million in 1991). There were 165 mineral springs and 
55 sources of therapeutic mud on the grounds of the resorts. 
There were 712 operating wells, yielding a total of 116 
m[.sup]3[/] a day (based on known reserves and water intake 
data). 
  The reduction of the number of clients (because of the high 
cost of travel and other factors) reduced the amount of mineral 
water and therapeutic mud used in large resort regions. 
  Changes in the number of vacationers, mineral water 
consumption, and the use of therapeutic mud at Kavminvod 
[Caucasian Mineral Springs] resorts are illustrated in Figure 
2.2.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-59A>           Figure 2.2.1. Vacation Dynamics of </FIG>



  The Russian Government has approved 96 quarantine districts 
on the grounds of the resorts of trade unions, the approval of 
40 more is pending, and another 15 should be approved before 
1995. Around 140 technological plans for the efficient use of 
mineral springs and sources of therapeutic mud have been drawn 
up. 
  The number of substandard water samples, displaying high 
levels of bacteriological pollution, at Kavminvod resorts in 
1992 was slightly lower than in 1991: water from the Narzan 
Mineral Springs in Kislovodsk (71 percent in 1992 and 81 percent 
in 1991) and Radon Springs in Pyatigorsk (45 percent in 1992 as 
compared to 50 percent in 1991). This was probably due to the 
general reduction of water use. 
  The absence of fundamentals of RF legislation on health 
resorts has precluded the necessary work to stop processes of 
degradation in territories of unique value to life and health. 
This is particularly true of the ``resort towns'' that sprang up 
when sanatorium and therapeutic treatment complexes were 
enlarged and transformed natural zones into urbanized 
landscapes, with all of the ensuing consequences. 
<H5>  2.3. Ethnic Territories </H5>
  According to the RAN Institute of Ethnology and 
Anthropology, 
there are 62 small indigenous nationalities in the Russian 
Federation, numbering 440,000 people in all and representing 0.3 
percent of the national population. 
  The presence of rich mineral deposits and unique biological 
resources led to two basic methods of economic activity and 
resource use in locations inhabited by the small national 
groups. The first--the traditional method of the indigenous 
people and a product of historical development--is based 
primarily on the use of renewable natural resources. The 
second--the industrial method--is connected with the industrial 
development of the territories inhabited by these small national 
groups, often with no consideration for the specific 
environmental requirements and existing lifestyle of the 
indigenous population. This has a negative effect on the 
ecological situation and the living conditions of local 
residents, especially in regions of the North, Siberia, and the 
Far East. 
  The mismanagement of natural resources in these regions 
causes irreversible changes in the natural landscape and the 
disfigurement and destruction of tens of thousands of hectares 
of reindeer pastures, forests, and hunting grounds each year, 
which, in turn, undermines the economic foundation of the 
survival of the small groups and produces other negative 
socioeconomic results. 
  In accordance with Edict No 397 of the president of the 
Russian Federation of 22 April 1992 ``On Immediate Measures To 
Protect the Native Regions and Economic Activities of Small 
Ethnic Communities in the North,'' agencies of the executive 
branch of the federal government are defining territories of 
traditional resource use that may not be appropriated for 
industrial or other purposes without the consent of the small 
ethnic communities of the North. 
  This work, however, has been seriously impeded by the 
absence 
of the necessary legislative base defining the legal status of 
the small indigenous groups and the territories of traditional 
resource use and ethnic-ecological regions. 
  This will require the passage of special legal instruments 
(RF legislation on the legal status of small nationalities, an 
RF law on territories of traditional resource use by small 
national groups, and others) for the creation of favorable 
conditions for the revitalization of the small ethnic 
communities and the improvement of their native regions. 
  Improvements in existing legislation, combined with 
organizational, economic, and educational measures, will promote 
ecologically sound methods of resource use in locations 
inhabited by the small national groups, as well as the 
preservation of their traditional lifestyle and their stable 
development on the basis of the appropriate legal foundation in 
a market economy. 
<H6>  Section 3. Environmental Effects of Economic Complexes </H6>
<H5>  3.1. Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>
  The fuel and energy complex (TEK), which is made up of 
enterprises of the coal, gas, oil, and petroleum refining 
industries and of power engineering enterprises, has a 
significant impact on the environment. The TEK is responsible 
for 48 percent of the pollutants released into the atmosphere 
from stationary sources and over 15 percent of the discharges of 
polluted sewage. 
<H5>  Coal Industry </H5>
  The main coal basins in the Russian Federation are the 
Kuznetsk, Pechora, Kansk-Achinsk, South Yakut, and Donetsk 
(Rostov Oblast) basins. 
  In 1992 the output of coal was 5 percent* smaller than in 
1991 and totaled 337 million* tonnes. 
  In spite of production cuts, emissions of harmful substances 
amounted to 394,000* tonnes, an increase of 7.6 percent* over 
the 1991 figure. The increase was connected with the failure to 
carry out scheduled projects to equip sources of emissions with 
waste treatment equipment (not one air filter or gas trap was 
installed in 1991), to begin using gas boilers, and to eliminate 
small boiler houses. 
  The coal industry is responsible for only around 1 percent 
of 
all emissions in the country, but the emissions of 
machine-building plants for the coal industry contain such 
hazardous substances as vanadic pentoxide, hexavalent chromium, 
and hydrogen chloride and fluoride. 
  There were no appreciable changes in the use of water 
resources and the dumping of sewage. Enterprises of the branch 
dumped 596 million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, 
representing 84 percent* of all the waste water requiring 
treatment, (mainly drilling fluid dumped without any treatment) 
into surface bodies of water. 
  The amount of treated sewage meeting standard requirements 
in 
1992 was 112 million* m[.sup]3[/], but the amount in 1991 had 
been 135 million*. Around 90 enterprises in the branch have no 
sewage treatment facilities. Discharges of certain substances in 
excess of standard limits ranged from 43 to 88 percent* in 
several production associations. 
  Enterprises in Perm, Kemerovo, Rostov, and Sakhalin oblasts 
dumped the largest quantities of polluted sewage, and this had a 
highly negative impact on the hydrochemical state of bodies of 
water. After the drilling fluid of the Kizelovsk coal basin was 
dumped in the Kosva and Gubakha (Perm Oblast) rivers, the grade 
III quality rating (``moderately polluted'') of the water was 
replaced with a grade VII rating (``extremely contaminated''). 
  Conservation projects are being carried out too slowly, and 
some projects have either been suspended or have not begun yet. 
The construction of waste treatment facilities in the mines of 
the Kizelovsk and Podmoskovye basins and the Almaznaya and 
Gukovskaya mines in Rostov Oblast, for example, is taking too 
long. In 1992 the new waste treatment equipment in enterprises 
of the branch could handle only 2,760* m[.sup]3[/] a day. 
  The enterprises of the branch have destroyed more than 
135,000* hectares of land, and only 2 percent* of this land has 
been reclaimed. The area reclaimed in 1992 was 2,600* hectares, 
which was 12 percent* smaller than the 1991 area. The reduction 
of annual reclamation area is seen mainly in the Kuzbass and the 
regions around the deposits of East Siberia and the Far East. 
The main reason is the shortage of funding and special equipment 
for this work. 
  The amount spent on environmental projects in 1992 was only 
5.9 billion* rubles, including 731 million* in capital 
investments. 
<H5>  Gas Industry </H5>
  The largest gas deposits in the Russian Federation are the 
Urengoy, Medvezhye, Gubkinskoye, Transpolar, Komsomolsk, 
Yamburg, and Yamsovey deposits in West Siberia; the Vuktyl 
deposit in Komi; the Volga-Ural oil and gas complex in Tataria 
and Bashkiria; and the Astrakhan and Orenburg gas condensate 
deposits. 
  There was only a slight reduction in the gas output in 1992 
(640 billion m[.sup]3[/] as compared to 643 billion in 1991). 
  The steady reduction of gross emissions of harmful 
substances 
has been recorded throughout the branch--from 2.526 million 
tonnes in 1991 to 2.138 million in 1992. Enterprises of the gas 
industry are responsible for around 20 percent of all harmful 
emissions (hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, 
methyl mercaptan, and others) from stationary sources in the 
Russian Federation. 
  Only 8 percent* of all waste gases are trapped and 
neutralized, and this is the lowest indicator in all branches of 
industry. In connection with this, many of the communities 
located near gas extraction and processing sites are on the list 
of cities with the highest levels of air pollution (the cities 
and settlements of Astrakhan Oblast). 
  Enterprises of the branch dumped 21.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
of polluted sewage into surface bodies of water and used 56 
million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992. 
  The amount of reclaimed land was 2,800* hectares. 
  The branch spent 5.3 billion rubles on environmental 
protection in the report year, including 3 billion in capital 
investments. 
<H5>  Oil Industry </H5>
  The largest sources of oil in the Russian Federation are the 
deposits in the West Siberian and East Ural basins. 
  The output of oil, including gas condensate, and of 
casing-head gas in 1992 was 400 million tonnes (87 percent of 
the 1991 figure) and 32 billion m[.sup]3[/] (91.4 percent of 
the 1991 figure) respectively. The quantity of recycled 
casing-head gas did not exceed 79.6 percent, and 8.2 million 
m[.sup]3[/] (82 percent of the 1991 figure) burned in the 
oilfields, mainly at West Siberian enterprises. 
  Enterprises of the branch are responsible for 10 percent of 
the gross emissions of pollutants in the Russian Federation. The 
most common pollutants are nitrogen and hydrogen oxides, 
hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Total harmful emissions 
decreased by 10 percent* and amounted to 2.5 million* tonnes, 
but there was a slight increase in emissions of solid particle 
and carbon monoxide. 
  The amount of water used in oil recovery in 1992 was 1.174 
billion* m[.sup]3[/], or 9 percent* less than before, and 
recycled water use decreased by 9 percent* and amounted to 1.631 
billion* m[.sup]3[/]. The quantity of polluted sewage 
decreased by 11 percent* and amounted to 21 million* 
m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The area of land included among branch assets decreased by 
13 
percent (in comparison with 1991 figures) and amounted to 
387,000* hectares in 1992. In the past year 12,700* hectares 
were damaged and 9,700* were reclaimed. 
  The number of accidents on pipelines in 1992 was slightly 
lower than in 1991. 
  Environmental expenditures in 1992 totaled 9.7 billion* 
rubles. 
<H5>  Petroleum Refining Industry </H5>
  Petroleum refineries discharged more than 1.5 million* 
tonnes 
of pollutants into the air in 1992, which was 54,000* tonnes 
less than in 1991. Emissions per tonne of refined oil amounted 
to 3.83 kilograms, which is considerably higher than foreign 
indicators. 
  Technological losses amount to around 2 percent of the 290 
million tonnes of oil and gas condensate refined each year, and 
the rate of irretrievable losses is 1 percent and exceeds the 
official limit. The reason is that only 437 of the 15,000 
refinery tanks are equipped with pontoons and only 81 have 
adjustable covers. 
  The improvement of gas-jet equipment considerably reduced 
hydrocarbon emissions at the Moscow refinery and one of the 
refineries in Ufa. 
  There was no major renovation of existing plants 
(refineries) 
in the last few years, and this has had negative effects on 
ecological conditions in Ufa, Angarsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Novokuybyshevsk, Salavat, and other cities where refineries are 
located. 
  The industry used more than 290 million* m[.sup]3[/] of 
fresh water for production needs in 1992. Proportional 
expenditures of water per tonne of refined oil ranged from 0.025 
to 2.2 tonnes, averaging 0.68 tonnes. 
  On the average, 94.9 percent of the water is recycled. 
Almost 
50 percent of all existing water-cooling towers require major 
repairs. 
  Although all of the enterprises of the branch are equipped 
with waste treatment facilities, only 20 have flotation cleaning 
units, 23 have biological decontamination systems, and 10 have 
complete decontamination facilities. 
  In 1992 the amount spent on environmental protection in the 
petroleum refining industry was 3.6 billion* rubles, including 
1.06 billion* in capital investments. 
  Petroleum product supply networks are an additional source 
of 
environmental pollution. They include more than 20,000 
kilometers of main pipelines with hook-ups to 265 consumers and 
a network of 7,600 gas stations, including around 7,000 serving 
the public. In 1992 the national economy was supplied with 142 
million tonnes of the main petroleum products. The total reserve 
capacity of oil installations exceeds 23 million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  Emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere in 1992 
amounted to 79,000 tonnes, including 66,000 tonnes of 
hydrocarbons, or slightly less than in 1992 [sic]. 
  The respective water consumption figures for operational and 
production needs were 7.5 million m[.sup]3[/] and 11 million 
m[.sup]3[/]. The recycled quantity is 9 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year (40 percent). Sewage discharges have 
stabilized in recent years and amount to 16.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year, with around 3 million m[.sup]3[/] 
dumped untreated. 
  Environmental protection measures in the petroleum products 
supply system cost 81.6 million* rubles in capital investments 
in 1992. 
<H5>  Power Engineering </H5>
  In 1992 the TES's of the Russian Mintopenergo [Ministry of 
Fuel and Energy] generated 662 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electrical power and 790 million Gcal of heat. This required 323 
million tonnes of standard fuel units (TUT)--25 percent coal, 12 
percent fuel oil, and 62 percent natural gas. 
  The TES's are responsible for over 20 percent of all 
emissions from stationary sources in the Russian Federation. The 
most common pollutants are sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon 
monoxide, solid matter, ash, and the most dangerous 
substances--vanadic pentoxide and benzpyrene. Total emissions 
were slightly below 1991 levels, mainly because of the reduced 
output of electrical power for industry and the use of more 
effective dust catchers. Nevertheless, the emissions of only 
half of the TES's stay within permissible limits. 
  Atmospheric emissions included 2 million* tonnes of light 
ash, 2.7 million* tonnes of sulfur dioxide, and 1.4 million* 
tonnes of nitrogen oxides. Emissions of light ash were 1.3 
million* tonnes below the 1985 figure, and sulfur dioxide 
emissions were 1.85 million* tonnes below the 1985 figure, while 
emissions of nitrogen oxides remained at the previous level. 
Pollutants released per tonne of TUT amounted to 19.3 kg, a 
decrease of 10 kg since 1985. 
  Emissions of sulfur dioxide in the ETR were reduced by 64.2 
percent of the 1980 figure and emissions of nitrogen oxides were 
reduced by 8.5 percent of the 1987 figure in accordance with 
commitments stemming from the Convention on Trans-Border Air 
Pollution. 
  The amount of water used in the generation of electricity 
and 
heat in 1992 was 25.5 billion* m[.sup]3[/]. The amount of 
water recycled was 59.3 billion* m[.sup]3[/]. Total water 
consumption was 1.8 billion m[.sup]3[/] below the 1985 
figure, and recycled water increased by 8.5 billion 
m[.sup]3[/]. Releases of polluted sewage amounted to 1.4 
billion* m[.sup]3[/] and were 43 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
below the 1991 figure. 
  The total area of destroyed lands on 1 January 1993 was 
17,700* hectares. The area reclaimed in the past year covered 
1,410* hectares, 471,000* m[.sup]3[/] of topsoil was removed, 
and 684,000* m[.sup]3[/] of previously stored topsoil was 
used, leaving 3.275 million* m[.sup]3[/] in storage. 
  A total of 10.3 billion* rubles, including 3.2 billion* in 
capital investments, was used for the protection and intelligent 
use of natural resources during the generation of electrical 
power and heat. 
  Hydroelectric power stations (GES's) generated 173 million 
kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1992. The construction of GES's 
and creation of reservoirs flooded 4.5 million hectares of land, 
including 1.6 million hectares of agricultural land and 2.1 
million hectares of forest and scrub. A million hectares were 
protected from submersion by a lower high-water mark. The 
irrigation zone of the water resources in reservoirs was 
equivalent to 5.5 million hectares. 
<H5>  Nuclear Power Engineering </H5>
  Enterprises of the RF Ministry of Atomic Energy can have a 
colossal impact on the environment. 
  The source of the potential danger is the entire process of 
the nuclear fuel cycle--from the extraction of fissionable 
material to the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. 
  Nuclear power plants produced 120 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electric power in 1992. 
  Harmful substances from stationary sources are emitted into 
the atmosphere by 104* enterprises. The total quantity in 1992 
was 1,159,500* tonnes, with 918,800* tonnes (or 77.1 percent*) 
recovered in traps. The total quantity of contaminants 
discharged into the atmosphere was 51,700* tonnes below the 
figure for the previous year because of improvements in 
technological processes and the reduction of production volumes. 
  Enterprises of the branch used a total of 6.3 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/] of water, including 4 billion* m[.sup]3[/] of 
sea water. The main water consumers were the Kola and Leningrad 
AES's--67 percent of the total. Recycling systems reduced fresh 
water consumption for production needs by 12.5 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/], and the recycling rate for the branch as a whole 
was 66.8 percent*. 
  The quantity of polluted sewage discharged (of the total 
quantity of 6.1 billion* m[.sup]3[/] of waste water) was 16.4 
million* m[.sup]3[/]--a reduction of 13.8 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] in comparison with the 1991 figure. Enterprises 
of the branch dumped 119,500 tonnes of various substances in 
polluted sewage and treated sewage meeting standard requirements 
in 1992. 
  In the past year 23 enterprises dumped 975.9 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of sewage, containing radionuclides with total 
activity of 268 kc (almost 100 percent in the waters of the 
Arctic seas). Most were short-lived isotopes. 
  The area of damaged lands totaled 52,263 hectares by the end 
of 1992, with 16 hectares reclaimed during the year. 
  Capital investments totaling 1.29 billion* rubles were used 
in nuclear power engineering for environmental protection and 
resource conservation. 
<H5>  3.2. Metallurgical Complex </H5>
  Production figures continued to decline in metallurgy in 
1992. The output of rolled metal was 15 percent* below the 1991 
figure, the output of steel pipe was 23 percent* below, and 
decreases in the output of nonferrous metals were 25 percent* 
for refined copper, 13 percent* for nickel, 23 percent* for 
lead, 15 percent* for zinc, and 41 percent* for tin. 
  Enterprises of the complex were responsible for more than 28 
percent of all harmful emissions from stationary sources in the 
Russian Federation in 1992. The largest quantities of pollutants 
were discharged by the Norilsk GMK [mining and metallurgical 
combine], the Kuznetsk, West Siberian, Magnitogorsk, 
Cherepovets, Novolipetsk, and Nizhniy Tagil metallurgical 
combines, and the Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines. 
  This was due either to the inefficient operation of existing 
air filters and gas traps or to their absence. Only 38 percent 
of all the substances in waste gases are trapped and neutralized 
at the Norilsk GMK, which is responsible for 8 percent of all 
the pollutants discharged into the atmosphere in the Russian 
Federation, and the figure at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical 
Combine is 51 percent. The most common pollutants are dust, 
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen 
sulfide, phenol, formaldehyde, and heavy metals. 
  The emission figures for all of the enterprises under the 
jurisdiction of the RF Committee on Metallurgy were 488,000* 
tonnes (or 11.5 percent) below the 1991 figures. 
  Emissions were lower by 108,000* tonnes (13 percent) for 
solid matter, 20,600* tonnes (9.7 percent) for nitrogen oxides, 
285,200* tonnes (11.8 percent) for carbon monoxide, and 64,000* 
tonnes (8 percent) for sulfur dioxide. 
  New equipment to trap and neutralize waste gases had a 
combined capacity of 3.609 million* m[.sup]3[/]/hr. 
  Fresh water consumption in the metallurgical complex was the 
same in 1992 as in 1991, and the quantity of polluted sewage 
decreased slightly. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Novolipetsk, Cherepovets, Kuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and 
Magnitogorsk metallurgical combines, the Kovdor and Lovozerskiy 
ore-dressing combines, the Ural Aluminum Plant, the Lysva 
Metallurgical Plant, the Pervouralsk Pipe Plant, and the 
Sevuralboksitruda Production Association. 
  Sewage treatment plants could not clean waste water to the 
required degree because of overloading, inefficient performance, 
obsolescence, and overuse. This, in turn, is causing the 
dramatic deterioration of hydrochemical conditions in bodies of 
water within the metallurgical enterprises' zones of operation. 
  Several enterprises of the branch stepped up their water 
conservation efforts. Discharges of polluted sewage into the 
Volga River were reduced by 11.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] by the 
Krasnyy Oktyabr Metallurgical Plant in Volgograd, discharges 
into the Lake Ladoga basin were reduced by 3.7 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] by the Alumina Plant in Boksitogorsk, and the 
Glinozem Production Association in Pikalevsk completely stopped 
dumping this kind of sewage. Less polluted sewage was dumped 
into the Lake Baykal basin by the Dzhidinsk Tungsten-Molybdenum 
Combine. 
  The use of new reagents--phosphonates--has permitted the 
installation of recycling systems at metallurgical enterprises 
in recent years. 
  Although water conservation projects have either been 
suspended or are being carried out extremely slowly, sewage 
treatment facilities handling 29,700* m[.sup]3[/] a day and 
recycling systems for 1,968,600* m[.sup]3[/] a day were put 
into operation. 
  Seepage from the many tanks holding all types of waste in 
the 
metallurgical complex is inflicting considerable damage on the 
water table. The polluted area of the water table below the 
Magnitogorsk Combine exceeds 150 km[.sup]2[/], and the 
Krasnyy Oktyabr Plant in Volgograd has polluted a 
20-km[.sup]2[/] area with iron, sulfates, and petroleum 
products in quantities 5-10 times the MAC. 
  Enterprises of Roskommetallurgiya [RF Committee on 
Metallurgy] annually reclaim virtually all of the land they have 
damaged as soon as they finish working the deposits on these 
lands (568.4* hectares in 1992), but these account for only 
around 2 percent* of the total area of damaged land. 
  Environmental construction projects in 1992 were financed 
exclusively by the enterprises' own funds. Capital investments 
in this area amounted to around 7.4 billion* rubles. 
<H3>  Norilskiy Nikel Russian State Nonferrous and Precious Metals 
Production Concern </H3>
  The enterprises of the Norilsiy Nikel Russian State 
Nonferrous and Precious Metals Production Concern, which produce 
75 percent of Russia's nickel, copper, and cobalt, occupy a 
special position in terms of production scales and environmental 
impact. 
  The locations of the concern's enterprises are distinguished 
by their ecological vulnerability. The unfavorable 
physico-geographic and natural-climatic conditions of the polar 
regions are the reason for their lower level of assimilation in 
comparison with the central latitudes. The emissions of the 
concern's enterprises create streams of pollutants which travel 
long distances. The concern's main enterprises are located in 
two ecologically distressed regions: the Taymyr Peninsula and 
Murmansk Oblast. 
  The emissions consist mainly of sulfur dioxide--around 95.4 
percent, and dust--1.9 percent. Recycling rates for the concern 
as a whole are 10.5 percent for the sulfur dioxide and 95.5 
percent for the dust. The concern's enterprises are responsible 
for more than 80 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions in 
Murmansk Oblast and around 30 percent of these emissions in the 
Russian Federation. 
  In accordance with the sulfur dioxide emission limits 
specified in the Convention on Trans-Border Air Pollution, the 
concern's enterprises in Murmansk Oblast reduced these emissions 
by 26.7 percent in 1992 in comparison with the 1980 figure. 
Further reductions will be virtually impossible unless 
metallurgical production units are remodeled. 
  The total water consumption of the concern's main 
enterprises 
amounted to 239.2 million m[.sup]3[/]. Around 45.5 percent of 
this water is used for household needs because the enterprises 
of the concern own housing in the cities where they are located. 
  Over 75 percent of this water is used by the Norilsk Mining 
and Metallurgical Combine (GMK), and its sewage releases exceed 
80 percent of the total. Around 92 percent of the water used for 
industrial purposes at the Norilsk GMK is recycled. 
  All of the sewage of the Severonikel Combine is treated 
prior 
to dumping, whereas 18 percent of the sewage of the Norilsk GMK 
and 43 percent of the sewage of the Pechenganikel Combine is 
released untreated. 
  Sulfates and chlorides are the main pollutants discharged by 
the concern's enterprises into bodies of water. The combined 
discharges of these substances by the Norilsk GMK and the 
Severonikel Combine amount to 136,500 tonnes. 
  Copper and nickel discharged with industrial sewage in 1992 
amounted to 129.9 tonnes, and 69.8 percent came from the 
Severonikel Combine. 
  The dumping of polluted sewage by the concern's enterprises 
affects the basins of the Kara (Norilsk GMK) and Barents 
(Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines) seas. The content of 
several pollutants in the bodies of water serving as receptacles 
for the sewage exceeds the allowable concentration, but even the 
background concentrations of copper and nickel in natural 
reservoirs exceed the limits for fisheries. 
  Water quality in the regions where the concern's enterprises 
are located has stabilized and is even improving steadily in 
terms of some indicators. 
  Specialists from scientific research institutes are 
assisting 
in the planning of several projects for the remodeling of 
reservoirs of the Norilo-Pyasinsk network. 
  The concern's enterprises spent a total of 7.8 billion 
rubles 
on environmental projects in 1992, including 49 million* in 
capital investments. 
<H5>  3.3. Chemical and Petrochemical Complex </H5>
  The chemical and petrochemical complex includes enterprises 
of the chemical, petrochemical, agrochemical, and 
microbiological branches of industry in all parts of the country. 
  The ecologically unsatisfactory production units in this 
complex are sources of air pollution by many specific substances 
in concentrations far in excess of the allowable limit. 
  Enterprises of the complex discharged around 1.6 million* 
tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992, representing 
around 6 percent* of all emissions in the Russian Federation. 
  These emissions are the main reason for soil pollution by 
metals in excess of the MAC within a radius of 5 kilometers 
around the cities where these enterprises are located. 
  In 1992 the enterprises of the complex used 2.6 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water. They dumped 2.9 km[.sup]3[/] 
of sewage, including 2.4 km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, 
into bodies of water. The quantity of sewage dumped exceeded the 
quantity of water used because the sewage treatment plants of 
several large enterprises handle the waste of other enterprises 
and residential communities. 
  Around 80 percent of the 2.9 km[.sup]3[/] of sewage was 
polluted, attesting to the extremely inefficient performance of 
the sewage treatment plants maintained by the enterprises. 
  The sewage contains large quantities of sulfates, chlorides, 
phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, petroleum products, and 
specific substances: formaldehyde, methanol, benzene, hydrogen 
sulfide, carbon disulfide, compounds of heavy metals, mercury, 
arsenic, cyanide, and others. 
  This is having a negative effect on the hydrochemical state 
of bodies of water. The water in the Belaya River above 
Sterlitamak, for example, has a grade III quality rating 
(``moderately polluted''), but below the city it drops to grade 
IV (``contaminated''). Virtually the same thing happens to the 
water in the Oka River after discharges of sewage from the 
plants in Dzerzhinsk, which increases the content of methanol, 
cyanide, and formaldehyde dramatically. Conditions in the 
Chapayevka River are deteriorating just as dramatically. The 
water there is virtually unfit for use after discharges of 
sewage from the Chapayevsk Chemical Fertilizer Plant because of 
high levels of pollution by pesticides. 
  The enterprises of the complex are polluting ground water 
with metals, methanol, and phenol in concentrations reaching as 
high as hundreds of thousands of times the MAC in areas 
measuring dozens of square kilometers, precluding the use of the 
water table for the supply of drinking water. 
<H5>  3.4. Timber and Wood Chemical Industry </H5>
  The largest logging regions in Russia are Irkutsk Oblast, 
with 11 percent of the total felling area in the country, 
Krasnoyarsk Kray--12 percent, Khabarovsk Kray--6 percent, Tyumen 
Oblast--6 percent, the Komi Republic--5 percent, and Arkhangelsk 
Oblast--4 percent. The felling limits of these krays and oblasts 
constitute 44 percent of the total limit in Russia. 
  Felling operations in 1992 were equivalent to 42 percent of 
the limit, including 47 percent for conifers. In the main 
logging regions the figure ranged from 24.6 percent in 
Krasnoyarsk Kray to 68 percent in Arkhangelsk Oblast, including 
a range of 34-80 percent for conifers. 
  Only Murmansk Oblast came close to the limit: 79 percent in 
the whole felling area and in coniferous forests. 
  The remaining wood left in the cutting area subject to sale 
throughout Russia amounted to 6 million* m[.sup]3[/], or 2.6 
percent* of all of the lumber cut in 1992, which was 1 percent 
above the 1991 figure. The quantity of timber in areas of 
unfinished felling operations amounted to 6.2 million* 
m[.sup]3[/], or 24 percent* more than in 1991, and 
represented 2.7 percent* of all the timber cut in 1991. Wood 
abandoned on the cutting site in 1992 amounted to 2.6 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] (101.2 percent* of the 1991 figure)--i.e., 1.1 
percent* of the output of lumber in 1992. 
  The largest timber industry complexes (LPK), pulp and paper 
combines (TsBK), and cellulose plants (TsZ) in the Russian 
Federation are concentrated in a few regions: 
  East Siberian--Bratsk LPK, Baykalsk TsBK, Ust-Ilimskiy LPK, 
Krasnoyarsk TsBK; 
  Northern--Arkhangelsk TsBK, Kotlas TsBK, Solombalskiy TsBK, 
Syktyvkar LPK, Kondopozh TsBK, Pitkyarant TsZ, Segezh TsBK; 
  Northwestern--Syaskiy TsBK, Svetogorskiy TsBK; 
  Kaliningrad Oblast--Kaliningrad TsBK's, Sovetskiy TsBZ [pulp 
and paper plant], Neman TsBZ; 
  Urals--Solikamskiy TsBK, Vishera TsBK, Krasnokamsk TsBK, 
Perm 
TsBK, Turin TsBZ, Lyalsk TsBK. 
  Economic difficulties in 1992 resulted in production cuts at 
enterprises of the timber and wood chemical complex. Decreases 
in output were equivalent to 11.4 percent for pulp, 24.3 percent 
for paper, 18 percent for cardboard, and 13 percent for 
commercial timber. 
<H5>  [No 24, 1993 pp 6-13] </H5>
  The enterprises of the branch annually release over 700,000 
tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere. Neutralizing equipment 
is so ineffective that it traps only 78 percent of the 
pollutants emitted from stationary sources, and the most typical 
of these are acetone, formaldehyde, phenol, xylene, toluene, 
butyl acetate, carbon disulfide, and methyl mercaptan. 
  The production activities of enterprises of the complex 
pollute the air in the cities of Arkhangelsk, Bratsk, 
Krasnoyarsk, and Perm. 
  The enterprises of the complex used around 2.5 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of fresh water a year, or 5 percent of the total 
amount consumed by Russian industry. Around 69 percent* is 
reused or recycled (around 77 percent* for RF industry as a 
whole). The reason is that fresh water is one of the raw 
materials used in several technological processes. 
  Enterprise sewage contains such pollutants as sulfates, 
chlorides, nitrites and nitrates, organic sulfur compounds, 
methanol, formaldehyde, furfural, tannin, and turpentine. 
  The construction of sewage treatment facilities has not been 
completed at some enterprises, although their completion is long 
overdue (scheduled completion dates of 1977 for the Visherskiy 
TsBK, 1985 for the Kaliningrad TsBK and Neman and Sovetskiy 
TsBZ's, and 1990 for the Kotlas TsBK). 
  The result has been the severe pollution of bodies of water 
near the enterprises of the complex. The water in the Vikhorevka 
River, for example, is where more than half of the sewage from 
the Bratsk LPK is dumped. The water in the monitored section has 
lost its grade III quality rating (``moderately polluted'') and 
has been reclassified as grade VII (``extremely contaminated''); 
after releases of sewage from the Visherskiy TsBK, the grade III 
water in the Vishera River turns into grade VII (``highly 
contaminated''). 
  The sedimentation tanks and even the production areas of the 
enterprises have a negative impact on the quality of ground 
water. The polluted area of the water table of the Selenginsk 
TsKK covers 70 square kilometers, and the content of harmful 
substances in the water exceeds the permissible quantity by 10 
times. The content of formaldehyde, furfural, and phenol in 
ground water near the Krasnoyarsk TsBK is even further in excess 
of permissible limits. 
  In all, enterprises of the complex used 1.6 billion* rubles 
in capital investments from various sources in 1992 for 
environmental protection and resource conservation. These 
included 95 million* rubles for the protection of water 
resources and 6 million* for air protection. New sewage 
treatment facilities completed in 1992 had a combined capacity 
of 8,100* m[.sup]3[/]/day and new equipment to trap and 
neutralize the pollutants in waste gases had a combined capacity 
of 150,000* m[.sup]3[/]/hr. 
<H5>  3.5. Machine-Building Complex </H5>
  The machine-building complex includes heavy, power 
engineering, transport, motor vehicle, machine tool, tractor, 
and agricultural machine building, the electrical equipment 
industry, instrument building, and other branches. 
  Enterprises of the complex are located in virtually all 
regions, but the enterprises with the largest output are in the 
big industrial cities in Moscow, Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Samara,Vladimir, Rostov, and Kemerovo 
oblasts, Krasnoyarsk and Altay krays, and the republics of 
Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. 
  These enterprises use 2.9* km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water a 
year, or 6 percent of the total amount used in production in 
Russia. 
  The amount used in recycling systems is 12.9* 
km[.sup]3[/], producing a savings of around 81.5 percent* in 
fresh water consumption. 
  The sewage released into surface bodies of water by the 
machine-building complex amounts to 2.438 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/], including 1.279 billion* m[.sup]3[/] (or 52.5 
percent) of polluted sewage, 975 million* m[.sup]3[/] (or 40 
percent) of clean waste water not requiring treatment, and 184 
million* m[.sup]3[/] (7.5 percent) of treated sewage meeting 
quality standards. 
  The main pollutants determining the quality of sewage are 
petroleum products, sulfates, suspended matter, and compounds of 
nitrogen, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, and chromium. 
  Enterprises of the complex have a negative impact on water 
quality in the Volga, Yenisey, Chulym, Miass, Iset, and other 
rivers. 
  Seepage from tanks and production areas has polluted the 
ground water in Tolyatti (VAZ), Yekaterinburg (URALMASH), and 
Moscow (ZIL) with phenol, heavy metal compounds, and other 
substances to levels far in excess of the permissible quantity. 
  The enterprises of the machine-building complex have 
365,000* 
stationary sources of pollution, including 352,000* established 
facilities. Combined emissions of atmospheric pollutants from 
the stationary sources of machine-building enterprises represent 
5.6 percent* of the emissions of these substances by all of 
Russian industry. 
  The emissions of 567* enterprises in 1992 exceeded 1991 
figures. 
  Total emissions amounted to around 1.6 million* tonnes in 
the 
year. Around 2.3 million* tonnes (or 59.3 percent*) of the 
pollutants in waste gases were trapped and neutralized, and 1.3 
million* were released without any kind of purification. 
  The most typical substances released by enterprises of the 
complex into the atmosphere are ammonia, acetone, xylene, 
toluene, styrene, butyl acetate, fluorides, nickel, chromium, 
lead, manganese, acids, benzene, ethyl acetate, copper, alcohol, 
oil, various types of dust, and others. 
  In 1992 the machine-building complex used 2 billion* rubles 
in capital investments for the protection and intelligent use of 
natural resources (1.6 billion* for water protection and 32 
million* for air protection), representing 4 percent of all the 
capital investments in environmental protection in Russia. The 
protection and efficient use of land in 1992 cost 32.5 million* 
rubles in the complex. 
  New sewage treatment plants installed at enterprises of the 
complex last year had a total capacity of 41,200 
m[.sup]3[/]/day. 
  The capacity of new equipment to trap and neutralize the 
pollutants in waste gases amounted to 545,000* m[.sup]3[/] of 
gas. 
  No new recycling systems were installed at enterprises of 
the 
complex in 1992. 
<H5>  3.6. Construction Complex </H5>
  The environmental impact of the construction complex 
consists 
of large quantities of solid and gaseous substances released 
into the air during the stages of open-cut mining and during the 
production of cement, asbestos cement, reinforced concrete 
items, and roofing and insulation materials. 
  The total quantity of pollutants released into the 
atmosphere 
by enterprises of the construction complex in 1992 was around 3 
million tonnes, which was slightly less than in the previous 
year (because of production cuts). Most of the emissions--around 
2.1 million tonnes (70 percent)--came from enterprises producing 
nonmetalliferous materials. The cement industry was responsible 
for 200,000 tonnes, asbestos cement production accounted for 
300,000 tonnes, and enterprises producing roofing and insulation 
materials were responsible for more than 200,000 tonnes. 
  In addition to stationary sources, the dust discharged by 
explosions and by open-cut mining has a significant effect on 
air quality. 
  Construction materials production pollutes the air with 
benzpyrene, soot, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, and 
formaldehyde, in addition to dust and suspended matter. 
  The negative effects of enterprises of the construction 
complex on air quality are perceptible in the cities of 
Krasnodar, Novosibirsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Saratov, 
Ulan-Ude, Novorossiysk, Barnaul, and Iskitim. 
  The enterprises where most of the waste is treated 
mechanically cannot provide for effective sewage treatment. The 
largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Uralasbest Combine in Asbest in Sverdlovsk Oblast, the 
Kovdorslyuda Ore-Dressing Combine in Kovdor in Murmansk Oblast, 
and the Bryansktsement Production Association in Fokino in 
Bryansk Oblast. They are polluting bodies of water with 
suspended matter, petroleum products, ammonium nitrate, and 
nitrates. 
  The extraction of natural resources for the construction 
complex has led to the use of large areas of land for mining. 
The total area of damaged lands in Russia amounted to 27,000 
hectares in 1992, and the depleted area amounted to 10,000 
hectares. Less than 10 percent was reclaimed. 
<H5>  3.7. Transport and Highway Complex </H5>
  The transport and highway complex is a major source of 
environmental pollution. Around 89 percent of the 35 million 
tonnes of harmful emissions are vehicle emissions and substances 
released by the highway construction complex, railroads produce 
8 percent, airlines produce around 2 percent, and water 
transport is responsible for around 1 percent. 
  Transportation plays a significant role in water pollution, 
and transportation is also one of the main sources of noise in 
cities and makes a sizable contribution to thermal environmental 
pollution. 
<H5>  Motor Transport </H5>
  Vehicle emissions in Russia amount to around 22 million 
tonnes a year. 
  The exhaust of internal combustion engines contains more 
than 
200 different harmful substances and compounds, including 
carcinogens. Petroleum products, the products of worn tires and 
brake linings, loose granulated and powdered freight, and the 
chlorides used for the de-icing of highways pollute the roadside 
and bodies of water. 
  Stationary sources of air pollution at motor transport 
enterprises of state jurisdiction (boilers and fans in 
enterprise shops and sections) released 52,000 tonnes of 
pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992. 
  The polluted sewage of motor transport enterprises exceeded 
8 
million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992, or 0.1 percent* of all 
industrial sewage in Russia. 
<H5>  Highway Construction Complex </H5>
  Asphalt plants produce the most serious air pollution 
because 
the emissions of these enterprises contain carcinogens. The 
asphalt mixers currently in use in Russia release from 70 to 300 
tonnes of suspended matter a year. A random survey indicated 
that all of these mixers had inefficient cleaning equipment 
because of design flaws, wear and tear, and the failure to 
perform regular maintenance operations. 
  Mobile objects used in the construction, repair, and 
maintenance of public highways annually release 450,000 tonnes 
of dust, soot, and other harmful substances. Stationary sources 
produce over 130,000 tonnes of pollutants. 
  The same enterprises dump 43 million m[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage into surface bodies of water each year. 
<H5>  Air Transport </H5>
  The considerable reduction of air traffic in 1992 reduced 
the 
total amount of atmospheric emissions in this branch to 280,000 
tonnes (as compared to 308,000 tonnes in 1991). Stationary 
sources released 42,000 tonnes of pollutants, which was the same 
as the 1991 figure, and only 18 percent of all the released 
substances were trapped and neutralized. 
  The impermissible noise levels of aircraft in residential 
communities adjacent to the airports of the civil aviation 
network are creating serious problems. The noise characteristics 
of modern domestic planes in operation for a long time are 
inferior to the characteristics of foreign aircraft. This has 
led to a perceptible rise in the percentage of people suffering 
from aviation noise, mainly as a result of the geographic 
expansion of airports serving planes with higher noise levels 
(Il-76T, Kl-86, and others) than earlier aircraft. 
  Around 2-3 percent of the population of Russia is now 
exposed 
to aviation noise exceeding permissible limits. 
<H5>  Rail Transport </H5>
  In 1992 emissions from stationary sources in this branch 
were 
estimated at 465,000 tonnes, and only 28.6 percent (as compared 
to 29.4 percent in 1991) of the pollutants were trapped and 
neutralized, while 331,500 tonnes were released into the 
atmosphere (98,200 tonnes of solids, 122,600 tonnes of carbon 
monoxide, and 21,500 tonnes of nitrogen oxide). Emissions from 
mobile sources were estimated at over 2 million tonnes. 
  The most harmful effects are produced by the metallurgical 
production units, and particularly the foundries, of branch 
enterprises, the remodeling of which has been delayed by 
problems with financing and equipment deliveries. Environmental 
projects had to be financed mainly by the enterprises 
themselves. In spite of this, several measures were taken in the 
branch to replace obsolete smelting units with ecologically 
superior equipment. 
  The branch dumped 70 million* m[.sup]3[/] of sewage into 
bodies of water in 1992, including 66.6 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
of polluted sewage. 
  Accidents involving trains carrying hazardous freight were 
caused by railroad schedule violations, defective rolling stock, 
and the overuse of rolling stock and caused environmental damage 
in several cases. 
  Sewage treatment stations capable of handling 4,000* 
m[.sup]3[/]/day were started up in 1992. 
<H5>  River Transport </H5>
  On 1 January 1993 the state river transport network 
consisted 
of 136 ports, 97 industrial enterprises, and 14 waterway and 
canal production associations. 
  Each year (according to 1990 data) during the navigation 
season, the vessels of the river fleet produce around 3 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of ordinary sewage, 550,000 m[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage containing petroleum, and 26,000 tonnes of garbage. The 
total quantity of all types of waste produced by the boats of 
the Russian river fleet is relatively small and is comparable to 
the waste of a city with a population of around 250,000. 
  Most of the water used by coastal facilities of the river 
transport is for normal household purposes and the supply of 
drinking water (57 percent) because of the large quantity of 
housing these enterprises maintain for river transport workers. 
  The most highly polluted sewage generated by production 
facilities in the branch comes from electroplating sections and 
shops. Around 25 percent of the enterprises have sewage 
treatment plants where production waste is processed before it 
is released into the sewer system. 
  The amount of polluted sewage dumped in 1992 reached 5 
million* m[.sup]3[/], and the amount of water in recycling 
systems amounted to 1.1* million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  Atmospheric emissions from stationary sources amounted to 
44,100* tonnes in 1990, 41,600* tonnes in 1991, and 42,670* 
tonnes in 1992--70 percent gaseous and 30 percent solid 
substances. 
  In Russia, just as in the rest of the world, there are no 
emission standards for the exhaust of diesel-powered vessels. 
<H5>  Maritime Transport </H5>
  The 10 Russian maritime shipping lines have 799 transport 
ships, including 683 dry-cargo ships, 99 tankers, and 17 oil and 
ore carriers. 
  The main types of waste produced by the ships are bilge and 
ballast fluid containing oil, the waste products of fuel and oil 
separation, oil residue and sludge, and oily rags. 
  Ships and enterprises of the maritime fleet used 26.1 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of water in 1992, the amount recycled 
was 9.36 million* m[.sup]3[/], and the amount of polluted 
sewage released was 10.7 million* m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The ships of the Russian merchant fleet are now based in 37 
ports. As a result of port operations involving the 
transshipment and storage of dry free-flowing cargo, many of 
which are performed outside because of the absence of the 
necessary quantity of specialized facilities, substantial 
quantities of pollutants enter the environment. Part of the 
cargo is carried away by rains, and part enters bodies of water, 
the soil, and vegetation in the form of dust. 
  At this time standard dumping limits and emission standards 
have been set for virtually all shipyards and ports. 
  Emissions from stationary sources of pollution at 
enterprises 
of the Russian maritime fleet amounted to 55,800 tonnes in 1992, 
and the merchant fleet used 4.08 million tonnes of fuel measured 
in conventional units. 
<H5>  3.8. Armed Forces and Defense Industry </H5>
<H5>  Armed Forces </H5>
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense makes use of 12.8 
million hectares of land, consisting of the land occupied by 
garrisons and by reserve airfields, artillery position areas, 
the security zones of particularly important installations, 
military tree farms and sovkhozes, auxiliary facilities, and so 
forth. 
  The Ministry of Defense has more than 1,200 large 
installations with separate supply lines. 
  The most serious sources of air pollution in the armed 
forces 
are garrison boilers operating on solid fuel, batteries, motor 
vehicles, and combat equipment. All military installations 
combined release up to 300,000 tonnes of harmful substances into 
the atmosphere each year, representing 0.8 percent of all 
emissions in Russia. 
  In 1992 the total quantity of water used for military needs 
amounted to 26 billion m[.sup]3[/], and around 22 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of sewage was released into surface bodies of 
water (less than 0.1 percent of the sewage of all housing and 
public utilities in Russia). 
  Several military installations, particularly in the Far East 
District, discharge some untreated household sewage (around 40 
percent of the total). Naval bases with coastal installations 
dump up to 453,000 m[.sup]3[/] a sewage a day, equivalent to 
around 5 percent of the amount of polluted sewage dumped by 
Russian maritime transport, and only 210,000 
m[.sup]3[/]--around 40 percent--undergoes treatment. 
  The number of missile tests decreased dramatically in 1992. 
The total area of the booster component landing zone allocated 
to the Ministry of Defense is 9 million km[.sup]2[/]. Rocket 
fuel components--substances in the first hazard 
category--accumulated in some parts of the Plesetsk test range 
over many years of use. At this time, there are no highly 
efficient technologies to clean up accidental spills of rocket 
fuel components, particularly in areas which are not easily 
accessible (marshes, mountains, tundra, etc.). 
  Air defense forces are facing the same problem. The arming 
of 
troops with new types of missiles has caused the accumulation of 
components of the rocket fuels of the old systems, which amount 
to around 30,000 tonnes in all. There is no technology for 
processing them either. 
  Leaks and spills of petroleum products and of fuel and 
lubricants are a major problem in the armed forces. The annual 
consumption of these exceeds 10 million tonnes. Most of the fuel 
depots and airfields were designed and built in 1956-1960, and 
no funds have been allocated for their repair and remodeling. 
For this reason, the absence, inoperability, or inferiority of 
environmental protective facilities in many fuel and lubricant 
depots can cause large fuel leaks and the pollution of surface 
and ground water and contribute to the creation of large 
lenticles. The practice of dumping unused fuel when planes come 
in for a landing has permeated the soil with kerosene on the 
grounds of some airfields. 
  The seas are also being polluted by petroleum products from 
the ships and boats of the Navy, particularly near naval bases, 
although the content of petroleum products in the water of these 
bases has been reduced to 5-10 times the MAC in recent years. 
The Navy's supply of vessels collecting bilge and ballast fluid 
and of floating sewage treatment facilities is just over 50 
percent of the total requirement, just as it is in the maritime 
fleet. 
  Novaya Zemlya is suffering from a unique environmental 
problem caused by military operations. It is the result of the 
air, surface, underground, and underwater nuclear tests that 
began to be conducted here in 1957, of the creation and 
deployment of the fleet of atomic ice-breakers, nuclear 
submarines, and nuclear-powered surface ships, and of the 
dumping of radioactive waste in the sea. 
  The absence of financing for environmental projects has 
created a particularly critical ecological situation in regions 
of military installations, and conditions have continued to 
deteriorate. The anthropogenic effects of military garrisons on 
the ecosystem, however, are commensurate with the influences of 
small or medium-sized industrial enterprises, and the total area 
of ecologically dangerous territories created through the fault 
of the armed forces constitutes less than 0.1 percent of the 
total area of these zones in Russia. 
<H5>  Defense Industry </H5>
  Because of the distinctive features of their operations (the 
production, accumulation, or destruction of weapons), 
enterprises of the defense complex are a serious source of 
environmental pollution. Their influence is quite strong in such 
regions as Leningrad, Vladimir, Nizhniy Novgorod, Perm, Omsk, 
Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Tomsk, and Moscow oblasts and 
Krasnoyarsk, Khabarovsk, and Maritime krays. The operations of 
defense industry enterprises are a source of high ecological 
risks and regularly create large-scale emergencies (the Mayak 
scientific-production association and others). 
  The main aspects of the environmental impact of defense 
industry facilities have not been analyzed sufficiently yet with 
a view to the present state of the most toxic chemicals and 
radioactive substances used in production in the past and the 
biological safety of current technological processes. 
  The emissions of defense industry enterprises in 1992 were 
estimated at around 700,000 tonnes, or more than 3 percent of 
all emissions in the Russian Federation. The main sources of 
pollution are boiler rooms and TETs [heat and power plants], 
metallurgical production units, and enterprises producing 
special chemicals. In spite of the low percentage of gross 
emissions of harmful substances by enterprises of the complex, 
the emissions are dangerous because they contain such substances 
as benzpyrene, metal oxides, and certain types of hydrocarbons 
in addition to dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Only 
30 percent of the enterprises of the complex are staying below 
emission limits. 
  The complex uses around 1.9 billion m[.sup]3[/] a year and 
dumps around 800 million m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage each 
year, or more than 8 percent of all of the sewage of this 
category in industry. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Kirovskiy Zavod Production Association and enterprises in the 
cities of Kovrov and Aleksandrov (Vladimir Oblast), Nizhniy 
Novgorod and Zhukov (Moscow Oblast), Chelyabinsk and other 
cities in that oblast, and Krasnoyarsk and other cities in that 
kray. The sewage contains heavy metal salts, petroleum products, 
phenols, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants. 
  Radioactive waste disposal (see Section 1.9) is now the main 
problem in the defense complex. 
  The present state, operations, and environmental impact of 
radiochemical and chemical production units and enterprises 
producing explosives constitute another major problem. 
Environmental conditions in Tomsk Oblast (in the city of 
Tomsk-7) and Samara Oblast (in Chapayevsk) are an example of 
this. 
<H5>  3.9. Agroindustrial Complex </H5>
  The agroindustrial complex consists of agriculture and the 
branches processing agricultural products. 
  Agriculture takes around 37* km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water 
out of reservoirs each year (33 percent of the total intake in 
the Russian Federation). Losses during transport amount to 
around 17 percent* of the total. A large portion (15* 
km[.sup]3[/]) is used for irrigation. The total amount 
discharged is 14.9* km[.sup]3[/], 13.6* km[.sup]3[/] of 
which ends up in surface bodies of water, while the rest is 
diverted to natural depressions in the landscape (trenches, 
pits, etc.). Agriculture accounts for around 40 percent* of all 
of the untreated sewage released in the country. 
  In 1992 the use of chemicals caused less environmental 
damage. In comparison with the average annual figures for 
1986-1990, the quantity of mineral fertilizers used decreased 
from 99 kilograms per hectare of plowland to 43, the quantity of 
pesticides used decreased from 1.5 kg/ha to 0.9, and the 
quantity of organic fertilizers used decreased from 3.7 tonnes 
per hectare to 2.1. The total quantity of liquid manure on large 
animal husbandry complexes amounted to 130 million tonnes and 
was 13 percent below the 1991 figure. Many animal husbandry 
complexes are polluting surface water with nitrogen compounds. 
  Many of the rural enterprises processing agricultural 
products are equipped with inefficient waste treatment plants or 
do not have these plants, and this eventually leads to 
concentrated pollution. 
  Of the 10,000* enterprises of the processing branches of 
industry, only 40 percent* in the meat and dairy branch and 60* 
in the food industry are using municipal treatment plants or 
releasing sewage into reservoirs after biological treatment. 
Existing biological treatment plants cannot meet the necessary 
standards. Because of this, the sewage of meat and dairy plants 
is only 83 percent clean, and the sewage of canneries is only 60 
percent clean. 
  The incorporation of waste-free and low-waste, 
resource-conserving technologies is becoming increasingly 
significant because they would minimize releases of production 
waste into the sewer system. 
  Agriculture pollutes the air with the emissions of boiler 
houses, obsolete refrigeration equipment, and foul-smelling 
gases. There is usually no preliminary cleaning to remove 
pollutants. 
  Capital investments in environmental measures in the 
agroindustrial complex in 1992 amounted to 2.332 billion* rubles. 
  New sewage treatment facilities have a combined capacity of 
only 35,600* m[.sup]3[/]/day. There are no new recycling 
systems at all. 
  One alarming symptom in some parts of Russia is the 
unrestricted construction of small meat, dairy, and other 
enterprises where it will be difficult to arrange for the 
treatment of sewage, the recycling of production waste, and the 
control of raw material and product quality. This could have a 
negative environmental impact in the future. 
<H5>  3.10. Public Utilities </H5>
  Municipal services and public utilities are expected to 
secure the ecological safety of the population in residential 
communities. 
  These services and utilities take more than 15 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water out of reservoirs each year, but 
no more than 90 percent of the water reaches consumers because 
of losses in the water supply networks. 
  These networks supplies consumers with 21.6 km[.sup]3[/] 
of water in 1992, including 13.8 km[.sup]3[/] for household 
needs. Average daily water consumption increased to 344 liters 
per person, but there were still differences in water 
consumption in different parts of the countries. 
  In 1992 these enterprises diverted 13.4 km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage into surface bodies of water. Only 7 percent* of the 
treated sewage was clean enough to meet standard requirements, 
and 93 percent* was still polluted when it was dumped. 
Furthermore, 1.4* km[.sup]3[/] was dumped untreated. Each 
year the sewage decontamination process produces around 80 
million m[.sup]3[/] of sediment. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped through 
municipal sewer systems in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, and Samara. 
  The contribution of public utilities to air pollution is 
created by around 15,000 municipal boilers emitting over 560,000 
tonnes of pollutants each year. Solid substances make up 30 
percent of the total (170,000 tonnes), and liquid and gaseous 
substances make up 60 percent (395,000 tonnes). They include 
110,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide (a rise of 0.7 percent over the 
previous year's figure), 218,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide (a 
rise of 4 percent), 62,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (14 
percent), 510,000 tonnes of volatile organic compounds (0.7 
percent), and 3,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons (5 percent). Only 33 
percent of the waste solid and gaseous substances of public 
utilities are trapped and neutralized. 
  In 1992 there were from 1 to 3 violations of the operating 
rules of Russian municipal services and public utilities in 42 
different regions. The highest number of accidents (50.5 
percent) occurred in the heat supply network, and there were 33 
accidents (32 percent) in facilities of the water supply network 
and sewer system. 
  An analysis of these accidents indicates that the 
dilapidated 
state of networks and equipment was the cause of 31 accidents in 
the heat and power engineering network and 7 accidents in the 
water supply network and sewer system. Violations of operating 
regulations caused 34 accidents. Five accidents were caused by 
explosions in sewer pumping stations and by gas explosions in 
residential buildings. Spills of petroleum products caused two 
accidents, and another 19 accidents had natural causes. 
  The construction of sewers and sewage treatment plants cost 
17.9 billion* rubles in state capital investments in 1992 (29 
billion* in 1991, or an adjusted figure of 28 billion*), with 
12.9* billion rubles provided by local soviets (20.8 billion* in 
1991). 
  The operation of the sewage treatment plants of municipal 
systems (including leased enterprises), capable of handling 
314,600* m[.sup]3[/]/day, and 464.9* kilometers of sewer 
lines was financed by state capital investments in Russia. The 
respective figures for 1991 were 527* m[.sup]3[/]/day and 
661.2* kilometers. 
  In 1992, 305* kilometers (318* km in 1991) of sewer traps 
and 
sewage treatment facilities with a total capacity of 209,000* 
m[.sup]3[/]/day were installed and began operating. 
  In view of the fact that the public utilities are part of 
the 
system of public supply lines, a comprehensive program should be 
adopted on the federal level for the economic support of the 
municipal economy, including a separate group of measures for 
the quicker improvement of ecological conditions in cities. 
<H5>  3.11. Production and Consumption Waste </H5>
  The waste products of production and consumption are among 
the serious technogenic problems for the environment. 
  Due to the lack of economic incentives for enterprises, the 
low level of technology, the shortage of modern waste treatment 
equipment, and the overall lack of high standards in production 
and consumption, only a few dozen types of waste products are 
processed and used. Because of this, the rate of their creation 
and accumulation (including large-scale waste products) within 
the territory of Russia has not changed. 
  Around a billion cubic meters of waste products, for 
example, 
have accumulated in the dumps of coal industry enterprises, and 
less than 5 percent of this waste is ever used. The reduction of 
local disposal has decreased the quantity of waste products used 
by 4 percent (in comparison with the 1991 figure), down to 47 
percent of the total. 
  Each year TES's [thermal electric power plants] produce 
around 50 million tonnes of waste ash and cinder. Approximately 
4 million tonnes of this waste is processed. The total area 
occupied by ash heaps amounts to 19,400 hectares. 
  In 1992 the operations of the mining enterprises of 
Roskommetallurgiya [RF Committee on Metallurgy] led to the 
accumulation of around 250 million m[.sup]3[/] of stripping 
rock, and 68.8 million m[.sup]3[/] (or 27.5 percent) was used 
for various purposes, including 42.4 million m[.sup]3[/] used 
as filler for mine shafts and 18.2 million m[.sup]3[/] used 
in the production of building materials. The quantity of 
concentration tailings was around 132 million m[.sup]3[/], 
and around 27 million m[.sup]3[/] (20.4 percent) were used, 
including around 11 million used in the production of building 
materials and ballast. The stripping and tailings were used in 
the production of more than 20 million m[.sup]3[/] of gravel 
for the enterprises' own needs and the needs of other 
organizations. Several enterprises producing building materials 
use stripping as their basic raw material. 
  Accumulated metallurgical slag and clinker amounted to 
around 
5 [sic] million tonnes, and 41.7 [sic] million tonnes, or 92.6 
percent, were processed. All of the blast-furnace slag and 
clinker of the nickel-cobalt subbranch were used, 57 percent of 
the slag in the steel industry was recycled, and this was also 
true of 50 percent of the ferroalloy slag and 2 percent of the 
clinker in the copper industry. Metallurgical slag is used in 
the production of cement, construction gravel, pumice, steel 
wool, and other products. 
  Each year around 7 million tonnes of metallurgical slag and 
more than 10 million tonnes of concentration tailings, as well 
as 34 million m[.sup]3[/] of stripping rock, accumulate at 
enterprises of the Norilskiy Nikel concern. Over 350 million 
tonnes of metallurgical slag has accumulated in all of the waste 
heaps of the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine and no 
more than 3 percent is being recycled. 
  Enterprises of the petroleum refining industry produce 1.1 
million tonnes of solid and liquid waste products each year, and 
around 80 percent are used at enterprises in the industry and in 
other industries. The waste products most likely to be used are 
sludge--98 percent, liquid organic products--99 percent, spent 
sulfuric acid--98 percent, the waste slurry of additive 
production--80 percent, and oil slime--65 percent. The waste 
products of synthetic fatty acid production, alkali-sulfur 
waste, the surplus activated sludge of biological sewage 
treatment plants, and used bleaching clay are almost never used. 
  Faulty technological processes are the cause of the 
accumulation of 115.3 million tonnes of solid and toxic waste 
products each year in the chemical industry. Only 32 percent are 
recycled, 25 million tonnes are burned or disposed of in dumps, 
and more than 50 million tonnes are stored in tanks. 
  Around 94 million tonnes of solid waste products and 97 
million tonnes of liquid waste products are accumulated in the 
agricultural chemicals industry, and 28 percent and 13.5 
percent, respectively, are recycled. Slime pits already occupy 
more than 10,000 hectares. Many pits are already full. 
  The heaviest waste product of basic chemistry is 
phosphogypsum--613 million tonnes a year. At this time, however, 
only 9 percent of the total is being recycled. More than 120 
million tonnes of sludge has accumulated in pits. 
  The calcareous waste of calcined lime production can amount 
to 700,000 tonnes a year; 79 percent of these waste products are 
being used. 
  The process for the derivation of synthetic fatty acids is 
accompanied by the creation of 350,000 tonnes of waste sulfates 
and 50,000 tonnes of waste acid; the respective levels of their 
use are 70 percent and 30 percent. 
  The use of chromium in the production of various items 
creates 333,000 tonnes of clinker containing chromium and 
calcium oxides. More than 8 million tonnes of these waste 
products, which are in the second hazard category, have 
accumulated in pits. Up to 311,000 tonnes of spent sulfuric acid 
is accumulated each year in the production of caustic soda, 
chlorine products, and other chemicals. The level of its use is 
80 percent, and the main user is the agrochemical industry. 
  The derivation of chlorine products also creates 56,000 
tonnes of organic chlorine waste, with a recycling rate of 27 
percent. 
  We have not taken full advantage of opportunities to recycle 
fundamentally reusable waste: worn tires (120,000 tonnes), waste 
containing rubber (170,000 tonnes is produced and 64 percent of 
it is reused), and the fibrous and solid waste of fiberglass 
production (36,000 tonnes is produced and 50 percent of it is 
reused). 
  The hazardous waste products of production and consumption, 
which are formed in quantities of around 75 million tonnes a 
year, are a special problem. Only 18 percent of these are 
recycled and neutralized. 
  The largest quantities of the waste products containing 
heavy 
and rare nonferrous metal salts and compounds of arsenic and 
hexavalent chromium (around 80 percent) are produced at 
metallurgical and agrochemical enterprises. Among the most 
hazardous industrial waste products created at enterprises of 
heavy and agricultural machine building and the chemical, 
petrochemical, and metallurgical industries, petroleum waste 
products occupy a prominent place (more than 600,000 tonnes), 
and so do waste products containing highly toxic substances 
(over 190,000 tonnes): benzpyrene, chlorinated and dechlorinated 
silicone monomers, and phenol compounds. 
  Nuclear power engineering enterprises are one source of 
hazardous waste. The enterprises of this branch produce more 
than 1.5 million tonnes of waste products a year: 22.4 percent 
are decontaminated and recycled, 46.4 percent are sent to 
special storage facilities, and 31.2 percent are turned over to 
other enterprises and agencies. Most of this waste consists of 
the byproducts of electroplating facilities (more than 2,200 
tonnes), waste containing mercury and its compounds (more than 
32,500 tonnes), inorganic fluorine compounds (over 37,000 
tonnes), and petroleum waste products (over 4,600 tonnes). 
Enterprises of the branch have accumulated more than 760,000 
tonnes of waste products from electroplating processes, 
containing nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper, and other metals. 
Slag is used in the production of ceramic structural elements, 
in glass production, and as additives in concrete and 
asphalt-concrete. Up to 95 percent of the waste products 
containing mercury and its compounds are sent to special storage 
sites. 
  Most of the hazardous waste (60 percent) produced within the 
territory of the Russian Federation is kept in special storage 
facilities. Most of the organized storage sites belong to 
enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy (where 69 
percent of their waste products are stored), the agrochemical 
complex (75 percent), and building materials production, 
primarily asbestos and items made of it (55 percent). 
  In some areas the toxic waste of power engineering 
enterprises (87 percent), heavy and agricultural machine 
building (50 percent and 32 percent respectively), machine tool 
building (20 percent), the chemical and petrochemical industry 
(23 percent), and the medical industry (20 percent) is taken to 
disposal sites for solid household waste (SHW) and to 
unauthorized dumps, although only 5 percent of the total waste 
of this category in the Russian Federation is disposed of in 
garbage dumps. 
  Household garbage is a major problem. Around 130 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of this waste is accumulated each year. At this 
time 124 million m[.sup]3[/] are sent to special disposal 
sites, and the rest of the waste is incinerated or sent to 
garbage disposal plants. The dumps and the runoff from the sewer 
system are polluting the ground water in several places, 
including 20 large areas near Pskov, Ivanovo, Smolensk, Derbent, 
Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, Yessentuki, and other cities. 
<H6>  Section 4. Regional and Interstate Ecological Problems </H6>
<H3>  4.1. State of the Environment in Russia's Economic Regions, 
Republics, Krays, and Oblasts </H3>
  The intensive growth of Russia's industrial potential in the 
1930s, the relocation of many industrial enterprises in the 
Urals and Siberia during the war, the restoration of ravaged 
production units in the postwar period, and the accelerated 
economic development of the country in subsequent years required 
the use of colossal quantities of natural resources, which 
increased the anthropogenic pressure on the environment 
dramatically in the absence of the necessary environmental 
standards and requirements and of resource-conserving, low-waste 
technology and efficient waste treatment plants. 
  The intensive development of industry in virtually all parts 
of Russia and the creation of large industrial centers in many 
regions were accompanied by the depletion of natural resources, 
high levels of water, air, and soil pollution, and a resulting 
rise in the rate of illness. 
  Ecological conditions in the country have not changed for 
the 
better in the last few years, and in many parts of Russia they 
have grown worse. This applies not only to specific cities or 
industrial centers or specific sections of river basins or seas; 
there are major environmental problems in vast territories 
inhabited by tens of millions of people. 
  Large quantities of polluted sewage are being dumped into 
surface bodies of water and the percentage of this waste in the 
total amount of sewage is constantly rising in Russia as a whole 
and in separate republics, krays, and oblasts. There is not one 
republic, kray, or oblast where natural reservoirs have not been 
polluted by sewage. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage (in percentages of 
the total for the Russian Federation) are being dumped in the 
following regions: 
  Moscow Oblast--11.6* 
  Krasnodar Kray--11.6* 
  Leningrad Oblast--7.5* 
  Irkutsk Oblast--5.6* 
  Krasnoyarsk Kray--3.9* 
  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--3.5* 
  Samara Oblast--3.3* 
  Sverdlovsk Oblast--3.0* 
  Tatarstan Republic--3.6* 
  Kemerovo Oblast--2.8* 
  The economic activities of all production branches in 
industry contribute to this category of sewage. In Moscow and 
Leningrad Oblasts, for example, most of this sewage comes from 
municipal housing services and public utilities, in Krasnodar 
Kray it comes from agriculture, and in Irkutsk Oblast it comes 
from industry. 
  The dumping of larger quantities of polluted sewage is 
primarily the result of the inefficient performance of waste 
treatment plants because of hydraulic overloads, physical wear, 
obsolescence, and negligence. 
  The untreated sewage dumped into bodies of water does not 
meet quality standards in Vladimir, Ivanovo, Kostroma, 
Yaroslavl, Nizhniy Novgorod, Volgograd, Saratov, Sakhalin, and 
Kaliningrad oblasts, in the republics of Kalmykia, Tatarstan, 
Karelia, and Tuva, and in the Mordvinian SSR. 
  In spite of the general decline of production, the quantity 
of harmful substances released into the atmosphere has not 
decreased in the last few years. This process reflects general 
economic tendencies, and not more intense air protection efforts 
at enterprises, because the percentage of trapped and 
neutralized substances is still the same in the Russian 
Federation as a whole--77 percent. This level, however, has been 
reached in only 25 of Russia's republics, krays, and oblasts. 
  The smallest quantities of pollutants from all stationary 
sources are trapped and neutralized in Tyumen Oblast--21 
percent, Dagestan--21.5 percent, Kurgan Oblast--34.7 percent, 
Kamchatka Oblast--37.5 percent, and the Komi Republic--39 
percent. 
  The largest quantities of pollutants from stationary sources 
are emitted in Krasnoyarsk Kray (10 percent of total Russian 
emissions), Sverdlovsk and Tyumen oblasts (7.5 percent), and 
Kemerovo Oblast (4 percent). The reason is the extremely 
unsatisfactory performance, and frequently the total lack, of 
air filters and gas traps. 
  As a result, the number of cities in the Russian Federation 
with high levels of air pollution has stayed virtually the same. 
  Anthropogenic effects on the environment cannot be measured 
only by the quantity of waste released into the air and water, 
and this is the reason for the following brief description of 
the specific ecological problems of Russia's economic regions 
and the territorial administrative entities making up these 
regions. 
<H5>  Northern Economic Region </H5>
  Murmansk Oblast is the most industrialized and urbanized 
part 
of the transpolar zone. Technogenic devastation has destroyed 
ecosystems on an area of 8,100 hectares near the cities of 
Monchegorsk and Zapolyarnyy and the settlement of Nikel. Their 
restoration is thought to be impossible. Of the 515,000* tonnes 
of sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere in 1992, 300,000 
tonnes came from the Severonikel and Pechenganikel combines. 
Besides this, 3,400 tonnes of nickel, 2,500 tonnes of copper, 
and 120 tonnes of cobalt were lost in these emissions. The 
emissions from these enterprises have damaged 126,000 hectares 
of forests, one-third of the territory of the Lapland State 
Biosphere Preserve, and the traditional habitats of small 
northern ethnic communities. Besides this, wooded areas are 
suffering from excessively high felling limits and the 
clear-cutting of pine forests. 
  The Apatit Production Association recovers only 40 percent 
of 
the raw materials used in commercial products from complex ores. 
The same association is a major polluter of surface water in the 
oblast, where 72 percent of the sewage is untreated. 
  The most serious problems in the Republic of Karelia are 
connected with the preservation of water quality in lakes Ladoga 
and Onega, the largest lakes in Europe, and the reduction of 
emissions in accordance with the Russian Federation's 
international commitments. To this end, pulp production has been 
stopped at the Lyaskelya TsBZ, located on Lake Ladoga, the 
stream driving of logs down the rivers of the Ladoga basin has 
been curtailed, and municipal sewage treatment plants are being 
built in several cities in the republic. The remodeling of the 
most ecologically hazardous production units and the 
installation of air filters and gas traps in the largest 
enterprises--the Kostomuksha Ore-Dressing Combine, responsible 
for 2.5 percent of all of the harmful emissions in the republic, 
and the Segezhabumprom joint-stock company--are being planned 
with the help of Finnish firms. 
  In Arkhangelsk Oblast, where timber felling and wood 
processing have always been highly developed, emissions from the 
pulp and paper combines in Arkhangelsk, Novodvinsk, and 
Koryazhma have produced an average concentration of methyl 
mercaptan that is 7-17 times the norm, and concentrations of 
hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, and formaldehyde that are 
2-3 times the norm. The continued dumping of the TsBK sewage 
into bodies of water is affecting the quality and quantity of 
vegetation in water meadows and reducing the catch of salmon. 
The rate of surface water pollution is always high near the 
intakes of water supply systems in the oblast. In 1992, 81.3 
percent of the analyzed water samples did not meet chemical 
sanitary requirements and 34.4 percent did not meet 
bacteriological standards. The use of ground water is 
complicated by the presence of strontium or iron in 
concentrations exceeding allowable limits. 
  There have been outbreaks of disease in pine woods and in 
increase in forest pathogens in the last three years because of 
anthropogenic changes. Areas of algae in the White Sea are 
constantly decreasing and are showing signs of decay. Changes in 
the state of the environment have increased the mortality rate 
of Greenland seals in the first year of life. 
  The concentration of facilities of the military-industrial 
complex and the Navy near Severodvinsk, the presence of spent 
nuclear fuel in temporary storage facilities, and the existence 
of discarded reactors in the area create the danger of radiation 
pollution. The Novaya Zemlya nuclear test range and the 
radioactive waste disposal sites in the White, Barents, and Kara 
seas are also located in the oblast. Many years of tests on the 
Plesetsk range contributed to the creation of seats of pollution 
in the oblast when the booster re-entry zones were contaminated 
by liquid rocket fuel components of the first hazard category. 
Furthermore, all of this is in the North, where the 
self-cleaning properties of biological objects, particularly for 
the removal of radionuclides, are extremely slow, and this could 
have the most negative consequences. 
  It has been suggested that environmental conditions in the 
Komi Republic still hold out the possibility of the augmentation 
of industrial potential. In terms of harmful emissions, however, 
the republic ranks third not only in its own economic region 
(25.7 percent* of all emissions), but also among all 
administrative entities in the ETR. 
  Pollution levels already exceed the norm in the tributaries 
of the Pechora River--the Vorkuta, Bolshaya Inta, Kolva, Izhma, 
and Ukhta rivers--in regions of coal and oil extraction and 
refining. The republic is facing the urgent problem of saving 
the largest population of Atlantic salmon--Salmo salar--in its 
rivers, because this population could lose all of its commercial 
value by the end of the coming decade if there are no changes in 
the existing protective regulations. 
  One-fourth of the damaged lands in the republic are occupied 
by tundra forests. This could turn the area of coniferous 
forests into treeless plains. 
  Vologda Oblast ranks highest in the economic region in terms 
of harmful emissions (29.2 percent*), mainly as a result of the 
emissions of enterprises in Cherepovets--more than 500,000 
tonnes a year. The soil in a 20-km zone around the Cherepovets 
industrial center is polluted by heavy metals. The Rybinskoye 
reservoir is being affected by the Cherepovets industrial center 
and the city's household sewage. 
<H5>  North-West Economic Region </H5>
  Industrial enterprises in St. Petersburg and Leningrad 
Oblast 
are responsible for most of the environmental pollution in the 
region. They account for almost 86 percent of all emissions, and 
these are mainly sulfur dioxide and solid matter. 
  Ecological conditions in the basin of the Gulf of Finland, 
especially Neva Bay, are still disturbing. The stabilization of 
water pollution at the ``moderately polluted'' level was the 
result of reduced sewage dumping by enterprises in combination 
with the stabilization or decline of production. Sewage from the 
cities of Novgorod, Kirishi, and Volkhov have a direct effect on 
the water in Lake Ilmen, the Volkhov River, Lake Ladoga, the 
Neva River, and Neva Bay. The waste water of the Leningrad 
nuclear power plant which is discharged into Koporskaya Bay is 
affecting thermal conditions in the bay and the adjacent 
territory. 
  More than 70 percent of the pollutants in the Lake Ladoga 
basin are released by sewage from facilities in Leningrad 
Oblast. The eutrophication of the lake is affecting the supply 
of fish. 
  As a result of water pollution, the sources of water for 
fish 
hatcheries in the oblast do not meet the requirements for 
hatcheries, and this results in losses of fish or the total 
depletion of fish stocks there. 
  The pollution of ground water on the Karelian isthmus has 
resulted in a lead content exceeding the MAC by 1.5-3 times in 
80 water intakes. 
  The constant overfelling of timber of the first and second 
quality categories, combined with the underfelling of timber in 
general, will have a negative effect on the state of wooded 
areas. The only native blue spruce forest is on the verge of 
destruction. 
  Radiation conditions in the oblast depend on the Leningrad 
AES. The Krasnyy Bor disposal site for highly toxic waste is a 
problem, because it was filled to capacity long ago, but the 
burial of waste there has continued. 
<H5>  Central Economic Region </H5>
  The Central Economic Region is distinguished by a high 
concentration of industrial potential and high population 
density. 
  The ecological situation in Moscow Oblast is disturbing. 
More 
than 3,200 industrial enterprises, poultry factories, and animal 
husbandry complexes and a diversified transport network have 
created levels of air, soil, and surface and ground water 
pollution that are always in excess of the norm. Around 55 
million tonnes of waste products (of which only 15 million 
tonnes are recycled) are produced each year in the Moscow 
region, including 14 million tonnes of waste from poultry 
farming and livestock breeding. The continuous reduction of 
wooded areas in the oblast is accompanied by the colossal 
pressure on these woods as the main recreational site of the 
region's population of over 16 million. 
  Moscow and the oblast are responsible for 25.2 percent* of 
the atmospheric emissions in the Central Economic Region. Water 
resources in the oblast are only one-fiftieth of the average 
supply in the Russian Federation. Territories reserved for 
landscaping are being reduced in the capital, and the 
self-restorative properties of natural resources have been 
exhausted. 
  The main sources of air pollution in Smolensk Oblast are 
industrial enterprises and public utilities, which are located 
in its central section--Smolensk, Yartsevo, Dorogobuzh, and 
other cities. Their sewage is responsible for much of the 
pollution in the Dnieper River in the oblast. The amount of 
polluted sewage dumped into this river basin in 1992 was 141 
million m[.sup]3[/]. The amount of water removed from natural 
sources in the oblast for the Moscow municipal water supply 
increased substantially in 1992. The enterprises of the 
Smolenskenergo Production Association are responsible for 68.5 
percent of the emissions in the oblast, and the Minudobreniya 
Production Association in Dorogobuzh is responsible for 6.1 
percent. 
  One of the unsolved problems with statewide implications is 
the radioactive pollution of several oblasts in the country, 
particularly Bryansk Oblast, as a result of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES. This is discussed in detail in section 1.9. Some 
of the cities in the oblast's southwestern rayons, the ones most 
heavily polluted by radionuclides, either have no waste 
treatment plants or have plants that are overloaded. In 1992 
there were 933 recorded forest fires (as compared to 191 in 
1991), and these could cause the dispersion of the 
radionuclides. Enterprises of the construction industry in 
Fokino release one-fourth of all of the pollutants in the oblast. 
  Despite relatively low emission and dumping indicators, the 
surface and ground water is polluted in Orel Oblast, 
particularly by petroleum products in Orlovskiy Rayon. More than 
60 percent of the farmland is threatened by erosion. 
  Ryazan Oblast is having a severe effect on the Oka River 
basin. All of the large tributaries of the Oka have average 
levels of pollution, but the levels are extremely high in many 
small streams. Furthermore, the dumping of polluted sewage 
increased by more than 5 percent in 1992 in comparison with the 
previous year and amounted to 71 million m[.sup]3[/]. The 
construction of waste treatment plants is a major problem. 
  Only 50 percent of the timber supply is used in the oblast. 
The soil is suffering from the reduction of humus. Some parts of 
Kasimovskiy Rayon have turned into a wasteland. 
  Immediate measures to improve the state of the environment 
are essential in Tula Oblast in the environs of Tula, 
Novomoskovsk, and Yefremov, where many branches of industry are 
highly developed. The oblast ranks second in the region in terms 
of atmospheric emissions (21.2 percent*), and second in Russia 
in terms of the anthropogenic stress on the territory. 
  The preservation of state memorial and natural preserves 
should be the object of special concern in the oblast: the 
museum-farmsteads of L.N. Tolstoy (``Yasnaya Polyana'') and V.D. 
Polenov. With a view to these factors and others, at the end of 
1992 the Russian Federation Government passed a decree ``On the 
Experiment in Tula Oblast in Perfecting the Economic, 
Organizational, and Legal Methods and Mechanisms of the 
Restoration of Its Territory and the Protection of Public 
Health.'' 
  The levels of water and air pollution in Kostroma Oblast are 
relatively low (except in the locations of large enterprises and 
power engineering facilities). The most difficult problems are 
connected with the felling and processing of timber. The 
practice of clear-cutting must stop. The waste products of 
logging and woodworking operations (amounting to 5.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year in this oblast) must be used, and 
submerged logs (estimated at 2.5 million m[.sup]3[/] in the 
oblast) must be removed from rivers where stream driving has 
been practiced. 
  One of the main ecological problems in Yaroslavl Oblast is 
connected with changes in the supply of surface and ground water 
under the influence of the Gorkovskoye, Rybinskoye, and 
Uglichskoye reservoirs: Farmland is being flooded, and changes 
in geological conditions have been recorded in Yaroslavl, 
Rybinsk, and other cities in the oblast, requiring the costly 
retrofitting of buildings and installations. The geochemistry of 
the soil cover is changing, zones of stagnation have been found 
in the tributaries of the Volga River, and the erosion of its 
banks is continuing. 
  Problems connected with waste, particularly industrial 
waste, 
are among the primary concerns in Ivanovo Oblast. Around 10.5 
million tonnes of waste ash and cinder have accumulated in just 
three large electric power plants in Ivanovo, and 600,000 tonnes 
of calcium sulfide have accumulated on the grounds of the 
Dmitriyev Chemical Plant. The oblast's cities in the cis-Volga 
zone (Kineshma, Puchezh, Yuryevets, and Navoloki) have no 
municipal waste treatment plants. Highly toxic sewage is being 
released into the Volga by the Trans-Volga Chemical Plant imeni 
Frunze. Enterprises in Ivanovo are responsible for 45 percent of 
the atmospheric emissions. Regular felling in excess of the 
limit is severely depleting timber resources. 
  In Vladimir Oblast, the water table in Kovrov is severely 
polluted by chromium salts. Wildlife populations have been 
reduced dramatically by hunters. 
<H5>  Volga-Vyatka Economic Region </H5>
  Most of the air pollution in the region is the result of 
emissions from enterprises in Nizhniy Novgorod (51.9 percent*) 
and Kirov (25.1 percent*) oblasts. More than half of the 
emissions in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast come from enterprises in 
Nizhniy Novgorod and Dzerzhinsk. Territories located on the 
shores of the Cheboksary Reservoir are threatened by its rising 
water level. As a result of the pollution of the reservoir, the 
only source of water for the centralized supply network in 
Cheboksary, this water does not meet the requirements of 
standard indicators for the chemical and biological consumption 
of oxygen, ammonium nitrate, and formaldehyde. The pollutants in 
the water are polluting the fish, in which the content of 
organomercuric compounds is 2-5 times the MAC. 
  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast is responsible for almost 
two-thirds* 
of the polluted sewage dumped in the economic region. 
  In Kirov Oblast the rivers are polluted by phenols (up to 7 
times the MAC), petroleum products (up to 20 times the MAC), 
copper (9 times the MAC), and zinc (4 times the MAC). The water 
in the Vyatka River does not meet the requirements of sources of 
drinking water. Logs are still being stream driven down the 
rivers. 
<H5>  Cis-Volga Economic Region </H5>
  Industry and agriculture in the cis-Volga region have the 
dubious distinction of being responsible for most of the 
pollution of the Volga River. The total quantity of runoff and 
polluted sewage here is twice the amount in the Volga-Vyatka 
region. Most of the emissions in the region come from 
enterprises in Samara Oblast (36 percent*) and the Tatarstan 
Republic (24 percent). Sulfur dioxide is the most common 
pollutant. 
  The cis-Volga region is the site of the most intense 
shrinking of forests. In Penza Oblast the excessive felling 
limits of past years affected the density of stands, the average 
supply of timber, and the quality of reforested areas. 
  Saratov Oblast is distinguished by a high level of plowed 
farmland (77 percent), and 85 percent of this land is prone to 
deflation. The regional rise in the level of surface and ground 
water as a result of new reservoirs and irrigation systems has 
caused the waterlogging, flooding, and salinization of the soil. 
Oak woods are shrinking everywhere. The steppe areas that were 
once so rich in a variety of grasses have disappeared completely. 
  Large industrial centers in Saratov, Engels, Balakovo, 
Volsk, 
and other cities create high levels of air pollution. Of the 
250,000* tonnes of emissions in the oblast, 107,000* are 
released in Saratov, and 45,000* are released in Balakovo. More 
than half of all of these emissions are specific substances. 
Sewage treatment plants are inefficient or nonexistent in some 
cities. The pollution of the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs 
has led to the appearance of heavy metal residue in fish. The 
oblast has sources of radiation hazards--the Balakovskaya AES, 
the territorial radioactive waste disposal site of the Radon SK 
in Tatishchevskiy Rayon, the industrial beryllium waste disposal 
sites in Saratovskiy Rayon, and others. 
  The presence of toxic substance storage facilities, a 
military installation with a chemical weapons test site, which 
was in operation for almost 70 years, and the Institute of 
Organic Synthesis Technologies with an experimental plant, which 
has been working with toxic substances for more than 30 years, 
creates particularly serious problems in the oblast. 
  Samara Oblast leads the economic region in atmospheric 
emissions and sewage dumping. The air in Novokubyshevsk, Samara, 
and Tolyatti is polluted by specific and more common substances 
in concentrations exceeding 10 times the MAC. The water in the 
Saratov Reservoir below these cities is severely polluted. A 
distinctive feature of the soil pollution here is the large 
quantity of petroleum products in the zones of oil production 
and transport. The damaged soils on agricultural land polluted 
by oil are suffering from salinization and alkalization. The 
grounds of vacation homes and vegetable gardens in Tolyatti and 
Samara are polluted by heavy metals. 
  The operations of the Chapayevsk Chemical Fertilizer Plant 
have polluted the soil, water, and air with dioxins. 
  Around 65 sites of ground water pollution have been 
discovered here on the grounds of large industrial enterprises 
and agricultural facilities, and around 40 are near currently 
operating water supply networks. 
  The reduction of the natural fertility of the land and the 
degradation of the soil by erosion, salinization, and 
technogenic stress have been recorded everywhere in the Republic 
of Kalmykia. The high water table, leaks in the main channels of 
irrigation systems, and the absence of storm drains flooded 49 
populated communities. In spite of this, there is still an acute 
shortage of drinking water. 
  Up to a million tonnes of salts are released into Lake 
Manych-Gudi with the highly mineralized and untreated sewage of 
reclamation systems in neighboring oblasts. The runoff from rice 
paddies in Astrakhan Oblast flooded meadows in the floodplain 
and caused Lake Sarpa to overflow its banks. 
  The situation around Chernyye Zemli is out of control. 
Several communities and several hundred animal husbandry farms 
either disappeared or were buried in the sand in the past 25 
years as a result of desertification. 
  Radiation conditions in abandoned uranium-phosphorus mines 
are being assessed so that plans can be drawn up for their 
restoration. 
  The preservation of the saiga population in Kalmykia is a 
major problem in the republic. 
<H5>  Central-Chernozem Economic Region </H5>
  The conservation and restoration of chernozem soils is a 
serious problem throughout the economic region. In Voronezh 
Oblast they represent 80 percent of the plowed land, but the 
soil there has lost more than a third of its humus reserves, and 
the humus content is below the norm on half of the area. 
Voronezh Oblast leads the region in fresh water extraction and 
in sewage dumping, including the dumping of polluted sewage. 
  This economic region and the Ural region are the leaders in 
chlorine emissions. Enterprises in Lipetsk and Belgorod oblasts 
are responsible for more than 75 percent* of all emissions in 
the region (60.6 percent* and 15.4 percent* respectively). 
Lipetsk ranks fifth among the nation's cities with the highest 
emission levels. The sewage discharged from treatment facilities 
at the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Combine and from slurry pits 
and enterprises in Lipetsk into the Voronezh River represents 97 
percent of all the polluted sewage in the oblast. 
  There is a chronic shortage of surface and ground water in 
Kursk Oblast. There is no waste purification equipment 
whatsoever in 19 of the oblast's cities and settlements. The 
future of the internationally acclaimed Central-Chernozem 
Preserve imeni Professor V.V. Alekhin is being jeopardized by 
intensive farming. 
  The cities of Belgorod, Shebekino, and Staryy Oskol are 
serious problems in Belgorod Oblast. The enterprises in these 
cities are major sources of air pollution and surface and ground 
water pollution. Ethers, aldehydes, alcohol, acids, and other 
elements commonly found in the emissions from a chemical plant 
were present in the air of residential neighborhoods in 
Shebekino in 1992 in quantities 3-5 times the MAC. The sulfates 
in the sewage this enterprise discharges into leach fields have 
polluted the water table. 
  All of the chemicals stored in tanks on the grounds of the 
Pigment Production Association, particularly the phosgene, 
constitute an environmental hazard in Tambov Oblast. 
<H5>  North Caucasus Economic Region </H5>
  The tendency toward changes in the composition of the soil 
is 
particularly disturbing in Stavropol Kray. Around 5.2 million 
hectares, or 84 percent of the total area, have been damaged by 
water and wind erosion. Erosion of all types has destroyed 26.6 
percent of the plowed fields, 42 percent of the pastures, and 39 
percent of the area of hayfields. Gullies and gorges are growing 
and already occupy around 23,000 hectares. Reclamation projects 
will be necessary to save 292,000 hectares of plowed fields 
suffering from varying degrees of salinity and 30,000 hectares 
of arable land with alkaline soils. More than 600,000 hectares 
are submerged and require immediate drainage. The water table is 
too high in 220 populated communities. 
  Sites of radioactive pollution by pipelines and geothermal 
equipment that were once in use, building materials from 
quarries with a high radionuclide content, and the activities of 
the Almaz Production Association were discovered recently. 
  The state of the country's oldest resort zone--the mineral 
springs of the Caucasus--is cause for concern. 
  Krasnodar Kray is another of Russia's important resort 
regions. The republic's acclaimed sanatoriums, serving the 
public's need for relaxation and therapeutic treatment, are 
located on the Black Sea coast in Tuapse, Anapa, Sochi, and 
Novorossiysk. The enterprises and sewer systems in these cities, 
however, discharge considerable quantities of polluted sewage 
and runoff (from rice paddies) into the Black and Azov seas and 
the Kuban River each year. In 1992, for example, around 90 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage was discharged by the 
municipal sewer system in Sochi. The city's beaches were closed 
several times because the sea was severely polluted. The air in 
the resort cities is polluted by the emissions of industrial 
enterprises and motor vehicles. In 1992 the cement enterprises 
in Novorossiysk discharged more than 30 percent of all the dust 
entering the atmosphere in Krasnodar Kray. The kray leads the 
country in vehicle emissions. 
  The Krasnodarskoye Reservoir has a significant impact on 
ecological conditions in Krasnodar Kray and the Adyge Republic. 
Settlements in three of the republic's seven rayons are flooded 
when the water level is kept too high and when water is pumped 
to the rice paddies in Krasnodar Kray. 
  The absence of a centralized water supply compounds the 
danger of the rising water table, because this pollutes sources 
of drinking water. At this time the water in the Krasnodarskoye 
Reservoir does not meet some of the main requirements for a 
fishery, but there are no other bodies of water for this purpose. 
  Rostov Oblast is one of the most highly polluted areas of 
the 
North Caucasus region. Pollutants emitted by industrial 
enterprises in the oblast amounted to 500,000* tonnes in 1992, 
or more than 40 percent* of all the emissions in the economic 
region. Most of the pollutants are discharged by enterprises of 
the fuel and energy complex and the metallurgical industry in 
Novocherkassk, Rostov-on-Don, Volgodonsk, Taganrog, and Shakhty. 
The air is also polluted by 230 waste heaps and the dumps 
surrounding coal mines in the oblast, more than 50 of which are 
smoldering. Around 200 m[.sup]3[/] of extracted rocks have 
accumulated here, and over 7 million m[.sup]3[/] are added 
each year. Water quality and sanitary conditions in the Don 
River and its tributaries in Rostov Oblast all the way down to 
the estuary, including the Tsimlyanskoye Reservoir, are 
influenced by pollutants carried from the upper reaches, from 
the territory of Ukraine, by the polluted sewage discharged by 
enterprises in the oblast, and by mineral fertilizers, 
pesticides, and other pollutants flushed into bodies of water 
from agricultural land and animal husbandry facilities. 
<H5>  Ural Economic Region </H5>
  The Ural Economic Region leads the country in gross 
emissions 
of harmful substances and of solid matter, carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, lead, chlorine, formaldehyde, and 
xylene. The region ranks second in the country in emissions of 
sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, fluoric compounds, hydrogen 
sulfide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, and phenols. 
  The largest share of total emissions is contributed by 
enterprises in Sverdlovsk Oblast (30 percent*) and Chelyabinsk 
Oblast (27 percent*). 
  Most of the territory is suffering from a water shortage. 
  Accidents at the Mayak Production Association and the 
release 
of sewage into the open drain made up of the Techa-Iset-Tobol 
river system polluted Chelyabinsk Oblast, where the production 
association is located, and Sverdlovsk and Kurgan oblasts with 
radionuclides. The high concentration of solid and liquid 
radioactive waste on the grounds of the combine is a threat to 
the environment and the population. 
  In Sverdlovsk Oblast the areas polluted by radionuclides, 
other than the East Ural radioactive track, are the settlement 
of Ozernyy in Rzhevskiy Rayon and adjacent territories, the area 
surrounding the Krasnoufimsk branch of the Pobeda Combine, and 
the Olkhov marsh near the Beloyarskaya AES. 
  The level of soil pollution by heavy metals near enterprises 
of the extractive industry and of ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy is from 50 to 200 times the MAC. 
  Enterprises in the watershed area of Sverdlovsk Oblast 
pollute the rivers of the Ob and Volga basins with sewage 
containing high concentrations of heavy metals. The reduction of 
timber resources in the oblast is perceptible, and the area of 
game preserves was once 1.8 times the present area. 
  Kurgan Oblast is distinguished by a limited water supply and 
a high rate of pollution in sources of water. The per capita 
supply is only half the average for the economic region. The 
water in the Iset and Miass rivers cannot be used for household 
needs, and the Tobol River is polluted by petroleum products, 
manganese, ammonium nitrate, and copper (average annual 
concentrations are 24 times the MAC in some areas). The water in 
all of the 106 small rivers is unfit for consumption. 
  The concentration of large industrial facilities in Ufa, 
Sterlitamak, Salavat, Meleuz, and other cities is the reason for 
the unsatisfactory environmental conditions in the Bashkortostan 
Republic. The negative effects of air pollution are compounded 
by lengthy periods of bad weather (up to 203 storm warnings a 
year). Dioxins were found recently in the air and water, and 
especially the soil, in Ufa and its environs. 
  The large quantities of water taken out of some sections of 
the Belaya River basin when the water level is low are the cause 
of a perceptible negative water balance. The stream-driving of 
logs has continued in several of the republic's rivers. 
  The development plans of earlier years for the Udmurt 
Republic focused on the establishment of a strong industrial 
complex. Defense industry enterprises constitute around 70 
percent of this complex. Military conversion and the dramatic 
reduction of defense requisitions led to a situation in which 
oil and timber are the main sources of republic budget income. 
Intensive oil production aggravated ecological problems 
perceptibly: There were 755 recorded accidents on pipelines in 
1992, and the ground water in Igrinskiy Rayon was polluted by 
petroleum products. Timber felling is reducing the supply of 
mature timber (which had already decreased to only 28 percent of 
the total) and the proportional number of coniferous trees in 
republic forests. Protected natural territories occupy 3 
percent* of republic territory. 
  Large quantities of chemical weapons (mustard gas and 
organophosphoric chemical warfare agents) have accumulated in 
Udmurtia, and their elimination will entail difficulties. 
  Territories bordering on the Tatarstan Republic are 
suffering 
from the trans-border drift of emissions from industrial 
complexes in Mendeleyev, Yelabuga, Naberezhnyye Chelny, and 
Nizhnekamsk. 
  There has been a rise in the rate of infectious 
diseases--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and tick-borne 
encephalitis. 
<H5>  West Siberian Economic Region </H5>
  This region ranks second among the country's economic 
regions 
in total emissions of harmful substances and in emissions of 
solid matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, and it ranks 
highest in phenol emissions. The largest share of the region's 
total emissions is contributed by enterprises in Tyumen Oblast 
(46.1 percent*) and Kemerovo Oblast (22.6 percent*). 
  Tyumen Oblast is the main region of oil and gas production 
in 
Russia and, consequently, one of the main sources of Russian 
export potential. State capital investments in the Tyumen oil 
and gas complex were cut substantially in the last few years, 
but they are still colossal (in comparison with other regions). 
Measures to protect the environment in the zone of this complex, 
however, have been ineffective and have not kept up with the 
growth of technogenic influences on natural biological 
resources, and this has created a critical ecological situation 
in this territory. The inefficient use of water resources, the 
high rate of accidents in oil fields and pipelines, and the 
dumping of polluted sewage (in excess of 120 million 
m[.sup]3[/]) are still inflicting considerable damage on 
bodies of water. The water is also being polluted by oil from 
several drilling rigs and around 10,000 containers of drilling 
fluid. The average concentrations of petroleum products in the 
northern part of the Ob inlet in recent years have exceeded the 
limit by 10 times on the surface and approximately 20 times on 
the river bed. This is an indication of chronic pollution and 
the repression of self-cleansing properties. 
  In the Ob Pond Fishery, a world-class acclimatization 
reserve 
and a sanctuary for the genetic stock of sturgeon, salmon, and 
lake whitefish, 25 of the valuable streams are totally unfit for 
use as hatcheries, and around 20 have lost part of their value. 
When ecological requirements were ignored during the 
exploitation of oil and gas deposits in the 30 years the Tyumen 
area of the North was being developed, the area of reindeer 
grazing lands decreased by 12-15 percent, the catch of fish was 
reduced by half, and fires destroyed around 1.3 million hectares 
of reindeer pastures and hunting grounds. The significance of 
domestic reindeer breeding and fishing as the mainstays of the 
native lifestyle in the region is constantly being diminished. 
  The fragile northern environment of the Yamal Peninsula has 
almost no protection against anthropogenic influences. 
Construction projects and the exploitation of mineral deposits 
are changing natural habitats, increasing stress, and reducing 
the number of animals and the variety of animal species. This is 
particularly true of rare species requiring protection. There 
are many such species in the Tyumen north. The zone of the 
Bovanenkovskoye deposit and adjacent territories alone are the 
habitat of 11 species of mammals and over 50 species of birds, 
including the endangered peregrine falcon, pygmy swan, 
red-breasted goose, and polar bear, as well as the large birds 
of prey and owls playing an important role in the tundra 
biocenosis. 
  The main sources of environmental pollution in Omsk and 
Novosibirsk oblasts and in Altay Kray are enterprises in the 
oblast centers, in Barnaul, and in several other cities, many of 
which are enterprises of the defense complex. Emissions of 
harmful substances in Omsk alone amounted to 404,400* tonnes in 
1992 (93 percent* of all emissions in the oblast), with 
respective figures of 162,100* (or 51 percent*) for Novosibirsk 
and 140,300* (or 41 percent*) for Barnaul. 
  Forests cover 35 percent* of the territory of Tyumen Oblast, 
and more than half are coniferous forests, including dwarf 
pines, and the unique fir woods of the taiga. This colossal 
resource potential, however, is not being used efficiently. 
Whereas 11.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] of timber (approximately a 
third of the felling limit) is cut down in a year in the oblast 
as a whole, systematic clearing in certain areas has reduced the 
number of trees in some woods to 20 percent or less of the 
previous number. Protected forests and stands of trees along 
rivers are being cut down. Each year more than 8 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of timber burns in forest fires. 
  On instructions from the Russian Federation Government, the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology conducted an expert appraisal of the 
ecological situation in the Kuzbass in 1992. The appraisal 
commission concluded that the Kuzbass qualified as an ecological 
disaster zone. It met the necessary ecological criteria and the 
criteria of public health in large industrial centers. 
  The sources of pollution in the cities of Kemerovo Oblast 
(Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, Prokopyevsk, 
Kiselevsk, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, and others) are more than 900 
industrial facilities, coal mining and transport enterprises, 
waste transport and management enterprises, and motor vehicles. 
More than 100 different harmful substances enter the atmosphere 
from stationary and mobile sources of emissions. The degradation 
and pollution of the soil cover are gathering momentum in large 
parts of the region. The soil in the 10-km zone around 
Novokuznetsk, for example, contains cadmium in 6 times the MAC, 
zinc in 5 times the MAC, copper and nickel in 2-3 times the MAC, 
and fluorine in 6-8 times the MAC. The most serious and 
irreversible changes in the geological environment in the 
Kuzbass include the technogenic damage connected with mineral 
extraction. Each year 1,500 hectares of tillable and plowed land 
is appropriated for open-cast coal mining and is not returned to 
agriculture for a long time. The use of waste products is not 
keeping up with the rate of their accumulation. Only 15 percent 
of the recovered stripping rock is used, and the waste products 
of other areas of production are never used at all. Water 
quality in the Tom River declines perceptibly downstream from 
the Moskovsk-Mezhdurechensk industrial center and the pollutants 
in the water are several times in excess of the allowable limit. 
<H5>  East Siberian Economic Region </H5>
  The East Siberian Economic Region is the leader in sulfur 
dioxide, sulfuric acid, fluoric compounds, and benzpyrene 
emissions. The main sources of these emissions are located in 
Krasnoyarsk Kray (66.3 percent*) and Irkutsk Oblast (21.2 
percent*). 
  A critical ecological situation demanding immediate action 
has developed around Norilsk in Krasnoyarsk Kray. This area is 
distinguished by extreme vulnerability to all types of 
anthropogenic influences and the slow self-cleaning and 
self-restoration of natural resources. 
  The main polluter of the city's environment is the Norilsk 
Mining and Metallurgical Combine, which releases over 2 million* 
tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This is the 
largest quantity discharged by any city in Russia. The sulfur 
dioxide emissions are killing trees. All of the trees are dead 
in wooded areas covering 180,000 hectares. The polluted sewage 
the combine dumps in the Shchuchya, Ambarnaya, Norilskaya river 
basins has cost them their value as fish spawning grounds. The 
presence of heavy metals has been recorded in water and plants. 
Accumulated toxic waste occupies an area of around 2,000 
hectares. 
  The ecological situation is also growing worse in other 
industrial centers of Krasnoyarsk Kray: Krasnoyarsk, Kansk, and 
Achinsk. 
  The strongest anthropogenic pressure on the environment in 
Irkutsk Oblast is exerted by enterprises located in the oblast 
center and some industrial centers--Angarsk, Bratsk, Zima, 
Usolye-Sibirsk, and Shelekhov (all of them are on the list of 
Russian cities with the highest levels of air pollution in 
1992). The enterprises in the Baykal basin warrant special 
attention because they are having a direct effect on the lake 
ecosystem. 
  A large part of the Republic of Buryatia is located in the 
Lake Baykal basin on heavily forested territory. This sets the 
main guidelines of ecological policy and adds special importance 
to water and forest conservation. The largest quantities of 
pollutants enter the Selenga River from the Ulan-Ude industrial 
center. Nitrites, petroleum products, hexavalent chromium, and 
ferric ions have been found in its water in concentrations 
exceeding the limit by 3-14 times. Other sources of water 
pollution in the Lake Baykal basin are enterprises of the 
construction complex, gold mining, and surface runoff from 
ports, logging organizations, and oil terminals. Severobaykalsk, 
located on the shore of Lake Baykal, is a danger to the lake's 
ecosystem. The environmental pollution here is comprehensive: 
The central sewer system serves only part of the city, waste 
treatment facilities are overloaded, some sewage is dumped into 
natural depressions in the landscape, and there are no storm 
drains. 
  The unfavorable conditions of the dispersion of pollutants, 
particularly from low sources, are also characteristic of Chita 
Oblast and contribute to the high levels of air pollution in its 
cities and industrial settlements. The pollution of the Khilok 
and Chikoy rivers, which are part of the Baykal Conservation 
Zone, soil erosion, and forest fires are major concerns in the 
oblast. 
<H5>  Far Eastern Economic Region </H5>
  Problems in water use and the use of land and forest 
resources are the most urgent and virtually universal concerns 
in this region. 
  Solid matter, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide are the 
most common pollutants in the emissions of stationary sources. 
The major contributors to these emissions are enterprises in 
Maritime Kray (25.8 percent*), Khabarovsk Kray (22.9 percent*), 
and Magadan Oblast (13.8 percent*). 
  The Sakha Republic (Yakutia) is one of the richest regions 
in 
the country in commercial mineral reserves, including some 
unique minerals. The republic is the source of raw materials for 
the production of many metals (zinc, iridium, tin, gold, and 
platinum), as well as diamonds, coal, natural gas, and gas 
condensate. The continued incomplete use of commercial minerals, 
resulting in the unwarranted growth of extraction volumes, the 
premature cessation of work on deposits, and the accumulation of 
waste, is a problem throughout Russia. 
  Yakutia, like other Siberian territories, is in need of a 
radically improved system of forest fire protection. In 1992 
there were 1,040* recorded fires in the republic on an area 
encompassing 215,000* hectares of forests--several times larger 
than the annual felling area. 
  The dumping of sewage, including polluted sewage, has 
increased in Amur Oblast. The main polluters are open-cut coal 
mines, gold mining enterprises, railway transport, and public 
utilities. Surface water in the environs of placer mines using 
amalgamation processes for gold mining contain excessive 
concentrations of heavy metals, including mercury. 
  Around 50 percent of the agricultural land in the oblast, 
the 
main agricultural region in the Far East, is marshy, 
waterlogged, and highly acidic. 
  The forests, the oblast's most valuable resource, are 
subject 
to regular fires covering large areas and to the effects of 
pests and diseases. The total area of protected territories is 
small--0.5 percent of oblast territory. 
  In Khabarovsk Kray, levels of air pollution are high in 
Amursk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, and Khabarovsk. The mining industry 
here is distinguished by considerable damage to the landscape. 
Over 40 percent of the timber in the economic region is cut in 
Khabarovsk Kray. In Maritime Kray a critical ecological 
situation has developed around the Rudnaya River. High levels of 
heavy metals, boron, and sulfur have been found in the water of 
that river and in the air in Dalnegorsk, Rudnaya Pristan, and 
adjacent territories. Lake Khanka is polluted by pesticides from 
rice paddies. 
  The fish resources in the seas off the east coast of Russia 
play a significant role in the economy of Maritime Kray, 
Kamchatka, Magadan, and Sakhalin oblasts, and Russia as a whole, 
and this attaches special importance to the protection of 
surface water and the seas. Most of the rivers of the Sakhalin, 
Kuril, and Kamchatka areas are spawning grounds for salmon, but 
half of the rivers in Sakhalin Oblast are exposed to constant 
pollution as a result of economic activity. In all, around 150 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage is discharged into 
bodies of water in the oblast, including 100 million 
m[.sup]3[/] from seven pulp and paper plants. The sewage in 
Kamchatka Oblast (50 million m[.sup]3[/] of which was 
polluted in 1992) is dumped primarily into fish ponds of the 
first and second categories. In Magadan, 80 percent of the 
municipal sewage is dumped untreated into the Sea of Okhotsk. 
Petr Velikiy Bay, the most polluted part of the Sea of Japan, 
serves as the receptacle for 400 million m[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage each year, including 90 million untreated m[.sup]3[/]. 
Fish resources suffer colossal damage from the activities of 
timber industry enterprises practicing intensive cutting, 
sometimes even in the upper reaches of rivers used as spawning 
grounds, and enterprises of the agroindustrial complex. On 
Sakhalin Island they are also threatened by the many geological 
prospecting, coal, and oil enterprises. 
<H5>  Kaliningrad Oblast </H5>
  Ecological conditions in the oblast are affected by the 
activity of enterprises of the pulp and paper industry, wood 
processing, machine building, metalworking, and thermal power 
engineering. They are responsible for 71 percent of the harmful 
emissions. The most common are sulfur dioxide emissions. 
  The sewage of enterprises and public utilities is affecting 
the quality of surface water and the adjacent expanses of the 
Baltic Sea by causing the asphyxiation of aquatic animals in the 
Pregolya River and some parts of Kursk Gulf. 
<H3>  4.2. State of Large Regions with Unsatisfactory Ecological 
Conditions </H3>
  The anthropogenic influences in several regions of the 
Russian Federation exceeded allowable limits and ecological 
restrictions long ago, thereby creating a critical situation in 
which the landscape is being changed in significant and almost 
irreparable ways, the danger of the depletion or loss of natural 
resources and unique natural objects is rapidly mounting, and 
the living conditions of the population are deteriorating 
perceptibly. 
  The regions within the territory of Russia include the 
Azov-Black Sea zone, the North Caspian region, Kalmykia, the 
central cis-Volga and cis-Kama zone, the Kola Peninsula, the 
Urals, the Kuzbass, the basins of Lake Baykal and the Angara 
River, and some others. 
  These regions are distinguished by a complex group of 
ecological problems, caused primarily by the polluting influence 
of large industrial centers and by the intensive use of natural 
resources (recreation, mining, and agriculture). These adverse 
influences are usually compounded in most of the areas by high 
population density. 
  The high concentration of production units and high 
population density in these regions, combined with the remainder 
principle of environmental project funding, has led to the 
dramatic deterioration of ecological conditions because the 
ecological capacity of natural complexes has either been 
exhausted or is close to this state. 
  The use of increasing quantities of water and the failure to 
recycle water, the increase in hydraulic engineering 
construction projects, the larger quantities of polluted sewage 
discharged into rivers and ponds, and the contamination of 
bodies of water with fertilizers and toxic chemicals from 
agricultural fields and the polluted runoff from urbanized areas 
have had a severely adverse effect on the state of the Volga, 
Kama, Oka, Kuban, and Angara rivers and other bodies of water, 
and in some regions they have led to serious problems in 
supplying the population with potable water. 
  The unique natural recreational areas of the Russian 
coastline and waters of the Black and Azov seas, which have 
experienced excessive anthropogenic pressure for a long time, 
have lost much of their resource potential, and this, in turn, 
could have grave interstate ecological and social consequences. 
  The ecological problems in the industrial zones of the Kola 
Peninsula were caused largely by the vulnerability of the 
landscape to technogenic influences and its weak self-cleaning 
capacity. Furthermore, the zone of ecological problems is 
constantly growing. The main problems on the Kola Peninsula are 
environmental pollution, the destruction of land, and the 
degradation of regional flora and fauna. 
  The main ecological problem in Kalmykia is the depletion or 
loss of natural resources (water, land, and biological 
resources). The exacerbation of water problems and deterioration 
of agricultural product quality in these regions are 
jeopardizing public health. In addition to this, the degradation 
of pastures as a result of excessive and disorganized livestock 
grazing is a major ecological problem in Kalmykia, where the 
land is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic influences (the 
salinity of soils, their weak mechanical composition, and so 
forth). This has intensified soil erosion and deflation and the 
general aridization of the territory. 
  The North Caspian region is suffering from serious 
ecological 
and public health problems, primarily in connection with the 
construction and operation of the Astrakhan gas complex. The 
main reasons are the low technical and organizational standards 
of the operation of the first section of this complex. This has 
created such problems as air and water pollution, the reduction 
of fish resources, and the deterioration of the natural state of 
the Volga-Akhtyubinsk floodplain. All of this has resulted in a 
higher rate of illness, and primarily among children. 
  In the central cis-Volga and cis-Kama region, the Kuzbass, 
the industrial zone of the Urals, the cities on the banks of the 
Angara River, and the Lake Baykal region, the effects of the 
oil, mining, chemical, pulp and paper, and heavy industries and 
enterprises of power engineering, intensive agriculture, and 
inadequate environmental protection efforts exacerbated 
ecological problems in the form of pollution, the destruction of 
land and disruption of natural processes in territories under 
special protection, and the degradation of regional flora and 
fauna. The ecological problems here have also been accompanied 
by changes in public health indicators. 
<H5>  4.3. Interstate Ecological Problems </H5>
  The Russian Federation has ecological problems in common 
with 
more than 20 countries because of common maritime or land 
borders and common interests in several border regions. 
  Within the framework of the cooperation by CIS states, these 
problems will be solved according to the terms of the 
multilateral agreement of 8 February 1992 and the bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements that are being drafted at this time. 
  The implementation of the agreement on interaction in the 
ecological sphere and in environmental protection of 8 February 
1992 will require concerted effort by the member-states, and 
must be reflected in an RF program for the fulfillment of agreed 
commitments in the following areas: 
  -- the coordination of environmental legislative instruments 
and ecological standards and requirements; 
  -- the joint drafting and implementation of interstate 
programs and plans in the sphere of resource use, including 
programs for the safe elimination and neutralization of chemical 
and nuclear weapons and highly toxic and radioactive waste; 
  -- the use of common approaches, criteria, methods, and 
procedures in evaluating the quality and monitoring the state of 
the environment and anthropogenic effects on the environment, 
and the guarantee of the comparability of data on the state of 
the environment on the interstate and international levels; 
  -- the use of agreed methods to assess the environmental 
impact of economic and other activity; 
  -- the standardization of methods of limiting the 
anthropogenic impact on the environment; 
  -- the use of agreed methods to monitor genetic changes in 
communities of living organisms and to protect rare and 
endangered species and their habitats; 
  -- the establishment and maintenance of an interstate 
ecological information system; 
  -- the planning and pursuit of a coordinated scientific and 
technical policy in the sphere of ecology and environmental 
protection and the organization of coordinated research projects 
in basic and applied ecology; 
  -- the elaboration and implementation of common principles 
in 
the establishment of incentives for environmental protection and 
penalties for violations of environmental laws; 
  -- the use of common procedures in environmental impact 
analyses of programs and forecasts of the development of 
productive forces, investment plans, and other project plans. 
  The collapse of the USSR and the formation of the 
Independent 
States objectively forced Russia to seek new ways of solving the 
acute ecological problems of recent years (the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES and the problem of the Aral) and problems that 
have accumulated over many decades (the degradation of soil, the 
pollution of air and water resources, the problem of waste 
management, and others). 
  The resolution of interstate ecological problems should be 
based on bilateral or multilateral treaties. 
  Due to the current absence of a single program for the 
protection of the rivers and seas of the Arctic Ocean in Russia 
and to the urgent need for ecological security, solutions will 
have to be found as quickly as possible on a bilateral basis for 
such problems as, for example, the pollution of the Irtysh, 
Ishim, and Tobol rivers, the water of which enters Russia from 
the territory of Kazakhstan in an extremely unsatisfactory 
state. Careful coordination will also be required for the joint 
resolution of the problems of the Northern Donets and Desna 
rivers with Ukraine and the problems of the Dnieper and other 
rivers with Belarus. 
  The protection of natural resources in the basin of the 
Caspian Sea will require new approaches. The protection of the 
sea's rich resources, the reproduction of its biological 
resources (particularly the sturgeon), and the protection of the 
sea itself from pollution, will necessitate the quick 
negotiation of a new agreement, by all of the states concerned, 
on an all-encompassing program for the preservation and 
augmentation of the rich resources of this unique body of water 
and the protection of the sea from pollution. 
  The same can be said of the basins of the Baltic, Black, and 
Azov seas. 
  By a decision of the governments of the Baltic states, a 
joint comprehensive program of environmental measures in the 
Baltic zone in the next 20 years was drafted and adopted at a 
diplomatic conference in April 1992 within the framework of the 
Helsinki Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM). 
  Russia will be solving the ecological problems of the Black 
Sea region in conjunction with other Black Sea states and it 
took part in the drafting of the UNEP/UNDP/GEF plan for 
environmental controls and protective measures in the Black Sea 
region. 
  The problem of reducing anthropogenic influences on the Kola 
Peninsula has become particularly urgent in recent years because 
this is causing irreparable damage to Russia itself and is also 
having the most negative effect on the ecological situation in 
Norway and Finland. 
  The use of the water resources of the Selenga and Amur 
rivers 
is one of the issues requiring discussion with Mongolia and 
China. 
  In addition, the Russian Federation inherited commitments 
assumed by the former USSR. 
  In connection with these, the Russian Federation has taken 
part and will continue to take part in the program for the 
preservation of the Aral Sea and fulfill the obligation to 
reduce emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides in the ETR. 
<H3>  4.4. Ecological Conditions in Large Cities and Industrial 
Centers </H3>
  Anthropogenic pressure exceeded all permissible limits long 
ago in several regions and cities of the Russian Federation with 
a high concentration of industrial potential. The growth of 
industrial production is accompanied by the growth of the urban 
population and the increased density of the population in 
industrial zones with limited territory. At this time, 109 
million of the approximately 150 million people in the Russian 
Federation are living in cities--i.e., in urbanized territories. 
  The main factors influencing the environment in urbanized 
territories are the quantity and composition of emissions and 
releases of pollutants into the air and water. 
  Industry and public utilities in the cities of the 
cis-Volga, 
Ural, Central, and Northwestern regions and the large cities of 
East and West Siberia are among the main sources of air, water, 
and soil pollution. Environmental conditions in large cities and 
health resorts are affected by these factors and by vehicle 
emissions, which can exceed 70 percent of the total. 
  Total emissions from stationary sources in the 100 cities 
with the highest emission levels represent around 50 percent of 
all emissions in the Russian Federation. The enterprises of the 
Norilsk industrial center are responsible for the largest 
share--around 2.5 million tonnes, or 8 percent of all emissions 
in Russia. More than 500,000 tonnes of pollutants are discharged 
by enterprises in Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, and 
Lipetsk each year. 
  The polluted sewage dumped into bodies of water by industry 
and public utilities in the 100 Russian cities with the highest 
sewage dumping indicators represents around 70 percent of all 
sewage of this category in the Russian Federation. The Moscow 
sewer system handles 2.4 km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage each 
year, constituting almost 10 percent of this category of sewage 
in the Russian Federation. More than 0.5 km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage is discharged into bodies of water in St. 
Petersburg and Angarsk. 
  In terms of total harmful emissions and releases of sewage 
into bodies of water, the following 60 cities are the leaders: 
Moscow, Norilsk, St. Petersburg, Angarsk, Novokuznetsk, 
Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, Cherepovets, Lipetsk, Chelyabinsk, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Samara, Bratsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Novosibirsk, 
Dzerzhinsk, Groznyy, Ufa, Yaroslavl, Arkhangelsk, Orsk, Vologda, 
Saratov, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novokuybyshev, Kemerovo, 
Sterlitamak, Rostov-on-Don, Tolyatti, Ulyanovsk, Perm, 
Novomoskovsk, Khabarovsk, Balakovo, Tula, Barnaul, Irkutsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, Vladivostok, Ivanovo, Nizhnekamsk, Krasnodar, 
Kirov, Orenburg, Kaliningrad, Kostroma, Voronezh, Salavat, 
Nevinnomyssk, Penza, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Tomsk, 
Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Ulan-Ude, Berezniki, Petrozavodsk, Belgorod, 
Cherkessk, and Prokopyevsk. 
  In cities like Magnitogorsk, Novocherkassk, Monchegorsk, 
Nikel, and several others, the degree of anthropogenic pressure 
is measured primarily in atmospheric emissions, while polluted 
sewage is the main criterion in Naberezhnyye Chelny, Syktyvkar, 
Ust-Ilimsk, Krasnokamsk, and other cities. 
  As a rule, high recorded levels of emissions and sewage 
dumping in cities and industrial centers are accompanied by 
excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air and water. The 
hydrochemical composition of the Moscow River, for example, is 
rated grade IV (``polluted'') above the city and grade VI 
(``highly contaminated'') below the city, and the water in the 
Miass River near Chelyabinsk has a grade II rating (``clean'') 
above the city and a grade VII rating (``extremely 
contaminated'') downstream. The average content of pollutants in 
the air of all 60 cities listed above exceeds maximum allowable 
concentrations, and the air in such cities as Bratsk, 
Vladivostok, Irkutsk, and Ulan-Ude is polluted by benzpyrene in 
10 or more times the norm. The same is true of the content of 
formaldehyde in the air of Komsomolsk-on-Amur and the 
ethylbenzene and carbon disulfide in Berezniki. 
  Around 50 sites of ground water pollution have been found 
within the boundaries of urbanized territories, and 70 of these 
are located close enough to public water supplies to influence 
their quality. The most serious problems with ground water 
pollution were recorded in the metropolitan areas of Moscow, 
Tula, Volgograd, Magnitogorsk, and Kemerovo. Ground water is 
polluted by sulfates, chlorides, nitrogen compounds, petroleum 
products, phenols, and heavy metals. 
  In addition to this, the water table under urban territories 
is rising almost everywhere, and this changes the chemical 
composition of the ground water and diminishes the strength and 
durability of the subsoil. This puts a strain on buildings and 
installations, reduces the service life of underground supply 
lines and increases the number of accidents on these lines, and 
promotes adverse and hazardous geological processes (karst, 
subsidence, collapse, and so forth). 
  An important element of the negative anthropogenic effects 
on 
the environment of urbanized territories is the pollution of the 
soil cover with the heavy metals in industrial emissions and 
with solid and liquid household and industrial waste. 
  Sources of radiation (waste heaps, test sites, and various 
installations) are too close to large cities in some locations. 
  Noise, electromagnetic influences, and thermal pollution in 
urbanized territories are additional factors with a detrimental 
effect on living conditions, but current controls are clearly 
inadequate. 
<H5>  4.5. Effects of Environmental Pollution on Public Health </H5>
  The changing socioeconomic conditions of life have naturally 
affected the state of public health, and this is reflected 
primarily in medical and demographic indicators. 
  Last year was the least promising of all the postwar years 
in 
Russia's demographic development. Changes in the medical and 
demographic indicators of public health attest to a lower birth 
rate (by 11 percent), a high rate of mortality (by 5 percent), 
and a substantial decrease in natural population growth. 
Indicators of oncological diseases have displayed a clear 
tendency to rise. The number of new patients is close to 400,000 
a year and shows no signs of reduction. The quality of the 
public diet has deteriorated dramatically. The shortage of 
complete protein in this diet can be as high as 20 percent, and 
vitamin deficiencies range from 30 to 50 percent. This is having 
a particularly pernicious effect on the health of children, who 
are displaying a higher rate of malnutrition. 
  Under these conditions, it is particularly difficult to 
single out the particular changes in the state of public health 
that are due to unfavorable environmental factors. 
  Some studies of the state of public health, however, suggest 
that the rate of illness, as one of the indicators of the state 
of health, is higher in territories with high levels of 
pollution than in relatively clean locations (the control group). 
  In Dorogobuzhskiy Rayon in Smolensk Oblast, for example, 
elements of the emissions from the Dorogobuzh industrial center 
(chromium, nickel, titanium, copper, and aluminum) have 
accumulated in the organism of children and nonworking women. As 
a result, the rate of pediatric respiratory disorders is 1.8 
times as high as the rate in a relatively clean region, and the 
rate of pediatric neurological disorders is 1.9 times as high. 
  Women living in the polluted zone of Tula Oblast (in 
Novomoskovsk) were more likely to suffer from complications 
during pregnancy and labor--29.8 percent and 21.3 percent 
respectively (as compared to 26.1 percent and 15.6 percent in 
the control group), and 2.11 percent or fewer of the children 
could be given the highest health rating (as compared to 4.2 
percent of the children in the control group). 
  Basically healthy children represented 38.6-50 percent (of 
the number surveyed) among the children living in the polluted 
zone of Mytishchi, whereas the figure was 73.9 percent in the 
control group. 
  Children living in the zone of exposure to the emissions of 
the Northern industrial center in Tolyatti were from 2.4 to 8.8 
times more likely to suffer from upper respiratory disease and 
bronchial asthma than children living in the relatively clean 
region, which was due to the irritating effects of nitrogen 
dioxide, formaldehyde, and ammonia, the average annual 
concentrations of which are 2-3 times the MAC. In Novocherkassk 
(Rostov Oblast), the rate of malignant neoplasms rose from 2.77 
(in 1988) to 3.57 (in 1992) per 1,000 inhabitants in the zone of 
exposure to the emissions from the electrode plant, and the rate 
of blood disorders rose from 1.25 to 4.49 per 1,000 inhabitants. 
  The emissions of enterprises nonferrous metallurgy (in 
Kirovograd in Sverdlovsk Oblast) are having an adverse effect on 
the state of reproductive processes, reflected in the increasing 
frequency of complications during pregnancy and labor (1.3 times 
the average or more). 
  People living near antibiotic production units (in Saransk) 
suffered from specific allergies to antibiotics and the candida 
antigen. 
  In rural areas of Rostov Oblast, where high levels of 
pesticides were recorded in the past (up to 20 kg/ha, with a 
regional average of 3 kg/ha), the rate of pediatric circulatory 
disease had risen by 113 percent, the rate of bronchial asthma 
in children had risen by 95 percent, and the rate of birth 
defects had risen by 55 percent by 1992. 
  Air pollution is one of the most acute problems in Siberian 
cities because of the extremely diverse composition of emissions 
and the unfavorable meteorological conditions of their 
dispersion. 
  In zones of intense air pollution, people are 2.3-3.1 times 
as likely to seek medical treatment for circulatory and 
cardiovascular ailments and genetic developmental defects. 
  Studies of the effects of environmental pollution on public 
health in the region of the Kansk-Achinsk fuel and energy 
complex (KATEK) indicated that the relative contribution to 
respiratory disorders was 51.6 percent for pollution, 21 percent 
for seasonal factors, and 22.5 percent for age-related factors. 
  In the cities of Chelyabinsk Oblast, where enterprises of 
ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy are responsible for more than 
80 percent of all emissions, there was a higher rate of illness 
in children and adults (in comparison with the control group--a 
city with machine-building enterprises) with endocrine, 
circulatory, and respiratory disorders; children were more 
likely to suffer from birth defects, and adults were more likely 
to suffer from complications during pregnancy and labor, skin 
diseases, and malignant neoplasms. The probability of various 
substances affecting the rate of illness was the following: 
11.6-42.5 percent for lead, 19.4-33.6 percent for benzpyrene, 
17.6-38.4 percent for ammonia, 3.6-16.8 percent for phenol, 
6.25-26.0 percent for nitrogen dioxide, and 32.5-98.0 percent 
for the combine effects of dust, sulfur dioxide, carbon 
monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. 
  When data on requests for medical treatment, the 
characteristics of emissions, and air quality were collated in 
Perm Oblast, simulation models indicated that 10 of 19 
categories of illness (52.6 percent) in children and 11 of the 
19 (57.8 percent) in adults had a distinct relationship to 
environmental factors. Furthermore, the cases of urogenital 
disorders (in Krasnokamsk) and osteomuscular disease (in 
Chusovoy and Aleksandrovsk) in children were caused by 
environmental pollution. 
  In the cities of the Kuzbass, where the public water supply 
comes from the Tom River, the quality of this water is having an 
adverse effect on the health of children, and this is 
particularly apparent in Yurga. In the last five years 
indicators of the frequency of premature births and birth 
defects rose to 1.5-6 times the previous levels. 
  Ever since the Chernobyl disaster the population of 17 
oblasts in Russia, especially the population of the western 
regions of Bryansk and Kaluga oblasts, has continued to be 
exposed to external and internal radiation by long-lived 
radionuclides--cesium-137, cesium-134, and strontium-90--and 
transuranic elements--plutonium-238, 239, and 240, 
americium-241, and others. For six years the residents of the 
most highly polluted regions of Bryansk Oblast were exposed to 
an average effective dose of 42 mZv (not counting the effects of 
iodine-131 on the thyroid). The cumulative effective dose over 
the six years was 5,000 man-Zv. If all protective measures are 
cancelled in 1993, the anticipated cumulative effective dose in 
subsequent years will add another 7,000 man-Zv, but if these 
measures remain in place it will add only 3,00-4,000 man-Zv. The 
medical consequences of this cumulative dose of radiation could 
amount to 400-6,000 fatal cases of oncological disease and 
100-150 genetic developmental defects in the 70 years following 
the accident. The anticipated rise in the rate of all types of 
pathology will be from 2 to 4 percent of the spontaneous level. 
The cumulative dose of thyroid radiation by iodine-131 for the 
same group was 22,000 man-Zv in 1986, which could cause around 
70 cases of thyroid cancer, around 7 of which would be fatal. 
  The anticipated increase in spontaneous thyroid cancer in 
this group will be from 20 to 40 percent, and the rate will rise 
by 1.5-2 times for people born between 1980 and 1986. 
Preliminary data on the rate of illness (in 1992) in the 
territories of radioactive pollution in Bryansk Oblast did not 
reveal the anticipated rise in the rate of thyroid cancer and 
malignant neoplasms of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems in 
children or adults. 
  The most unfavorable radiation conditions resulting from the 
accidents at the Mayak Scientific Production Association in 
Chelyabinsk, distinguished by high levels of radiation and 
prolonged exposure, developed in the coastal regions of the 
Techa River (in Chelyabinsk and Kurgan oblasts). The average 
absorbed dose of radiation for the population of the upper 
reaches of the river had reached 170 cZv by 1992. Cases of 
chronic radiation sickness had been recorded here earlier, and 
now there are signs of a higher rate of oncological disease, 
including leukemia. 
  Radioactive tracks from nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk 
test range prior to 1964 reached regions of Altay Kray and part 
of the territory of the Altay Republic. Now these areas are 
displaying a striking increase in oncological diseases of the 
pulmonary, female reproductive, lymphatic, and hematopoeic 
systems. Special programs are being conducted by scientific 
institutions and other organizations in these regions for 
in-depth studies of the state of public health and the possible 
effects of radiation on public health. There is a similar 
situation in regions of the Far North, where it will be 
essential to study the population of the exposure zone of the 
Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site. This is also the location of 
the geographic accumulation of all of the global fall-out from 
nuclear tests conducted by all countries of the northern 
hemisphere in the far northern latitudes. Concerned ministries 
and departments are drawing up a special comprehensive program 
for this and are already doing some of the necessary research.

<H6>  Section 5. Industrial Accidents, Natural Emergencies, and 
Their Ecological Consequences and Prevention </H6>
<H5>  5.1. Accidents </H5>
  In 1992, according to the data of the Information Center of 
the Russian State Committee on Emergency Situations (GKChS), 
there were 769 emergency situations (ChS) of a technogenic 
nature in the Russian Federation, with 2,523 victims, including 
870 fatalities (the respective figures in 1991 were 2,693 and 
1,023) (see figures 5.1.1-5.1.3). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-85A>           Figure 5.1.1. Technogenic </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-86A>           Figure 5.1.2. Fatalities in </FIG>






  Most of the industrial ChS were fires and explosions (314) 
and transport accidents (298). The victims of transport 
accidents numbered 1,762, including 698 fatalities. There were 
1,117 victims of traffic accidents on highways, including 374 
fatalities, and the respective figures for air disasters were 
357 and 248. 
  Fires and explosions caused the greatest financial damage to 
the national economy. According to the data of Gosgortekhnadzor 
[Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight], there were 
430 production-related accidents with 652 fatalities. The slight 
decrease in human losses in the technical sphere was due to the 
considerable decrease in production rates and volumes. In highly 
hazardous branches there was a tendency toward more accidents 
with graver consequences. 
  There were 126 accidents at enterprises of the coal 
industry, 
including 22 explosions and deflagrations of methane and coal 
oil, 57 fires, 14 cave-ins, 3 unexpected coal and gas blowouts, 
and 4 water and slurry breakthroughs. In all, 263 people died in 
these accidents (185 in 1991). 
  The number of accidents at the mining enterprises of ferrous 
metallurgy, agrochemical resources, and building materials 
production rose from 19 to 28. 
  Ten accidents at enterprises of the metallurgical industry 
(five in 1991) claimed 30 lives. 
  The number of accident victims increased in mining and 
nonmetalliferous industries in 1992: by 18 percent at the mining 
enterprises of ferrous metallurgy, by a factor of 2.5 in 
agrochemical resource production, and by 100 percent in the 
building materials industry. 
  The protracted operation, unsatisfactory state, and constant 
overloading of the structural elements of buildings and 
installations caused cave-ins and collapses at the Severnyy Pipe 
Plant, the Chusovoy Metallurgical Plant, and the Pechenganikel 
Combine. Several buildings and installations of the Kuznetsk and 
Orsk-Khalilov metallurgical combines are in the same state. 
  There were 24 fatalities (11 in 1991) at enterprises and 
installations of the Rosneftegaz Corporation and other oil and 
gas enterprises (joint-stock companies, joint ventures, and 
other types of enterprises), where the number of accidents rose 
from 16 to 21. There was an increase in the number of accidents 
in this branch connected with fires (of 50 percent), derrick 
damage (75 percent), and the collapse of rigs (20 percent). The 
number of oil and gas spouters decreased from 10 to 8, but they 
still accounted for a high percentage of all accidents (27 
percent). The results of an inventory of branch enterprises in 
1992 (during which around 400,000 objects were inspected) 
revealed that 12,000 objects had to be shut down immediately, 
and 4,300 required radical renovation and modernization. 
  In all, 35 accidents were recorded in the oil and gas 
pipelines and compressor and pumping stations overseen by the 
Russian Federation Gosgortekhnadzor. The main causes were 
corrosion, mechanical failures, faulty construction and 
installation work, and pipe defects. Breaks in pipelines and 
spills of petroleum products were accompanied in many cases by 
the severe contamination of the soil, surface water, and seas 
(in the Komi Republic, Khabarovsk and Maritime krays, 
Arkhangelsk and Kurgan oblasts, and other locations). 
  There were 83 accidents at enterprises of the chemical, 
petrochemical, agrochemical, microbiological, and petroleum 
refining industries with damage to production equipment, 
buildings, and installations. The situation was most alarming at 
chemical enterprises of the Bashkortostan Republic, Stavropol 
Kray, and Irkutsk and Orenburg oblasts. 
  The main causes of production-related accidents were 
flagrant 
violations of safety requirements by supervisors, specialists, 
and personnel, deviations from established procedures and 
regulations, the structural defects and malfunctions of 
equipment, machines, and mechanisms, and faulty designs. 
  There was a higher number of emergency situations and 
accidents in the transport of hazardous freight by rail. More 
than 75 percent of these incidents were connected with the 
transport of hazardous freight in damaged tank cars. 
  There were 12 train wrecks and accidents and 1,020 other 
incidents, including spills of hydrocarbons, petroleum products, 
and various chemicals, on the main trunk lines and industrial 
rail lines. Environmental pollution as a result of these 
incidents was recorded on many railroads (Transbaykal, Gorkiy, 
Baykal-Amur, Moscow, Oktyabr, Northern, Southeastern, and West 
Siberian). 
  Accidents resulting in the release of virulent toxic 
substances (VTS) represented 4.7 percent of all the technogenic 
emergencies. 
  Accidents in supply lines (ranking third among all 
accidents)--sewer systems and mains--resulted in the release of 
liquid waste in surface bodies of water in Perm, Omsk, and 
Khabarovsk and caused serious environmental damage. 
  There were 49 accidents at gas works, and the number of 
fatalities rose from 6 to 13. The state of gas lines in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg is particularly unsatisfactory. More than 
2,000 kilometers of gas lines require immediate replacement, and 
18,000 kilometers have to be protected from electrochemical 
corrosion. 
  The number of accidents connected with the operation of 
boilers and furnaces increased by 36 percent in 1992. 
  There were 205 violations of regulations at operating 
nuclear 
power plants (AES), as compared to 164 in 1991 (an increase of 
19 percent), with 75 percent occurring in power plants with VVER 
reactors and 20 percent in plants with RBMK reactors. 
  The most serious violations were the accident in the third 
reactor of the Leningrad AES, accompanied by the release of 
excess radioactive substances (RV) into the environment, and the 
personnel error resulting in the release of radioactive water 
into the cooling tank at the Beloyarskaya AES (total activity of 
0.093 in relation to the annual maximum). 
  No nuclear or radiation accidents or violations resulting in 
unsafe operating conditions were recorded in 75 research 
reactors and critical and subcritical test units in 1992. After 
the two industrial reactors of the mineral chemical combine in 
Krasnoyarsk-26 were shut down in 1992 (in accordance with a 
decree of the Russian Gosatomnadzor [Russian Federal Oversight 
of Nuclear and Radiation Safety]), radiation readings in waste 
disposal sites in the Yenisey River improved dramatically. 
  An analysis of the industrial accidents from the regional 
standpoint indicated that the highest number (61) occurred in 
Tyumen Oblast and in Krasnodar (39) and Krasnoyarsk (43) krays. 
Most of these were fires and explosions. 
  A significant increase in the number of industrial accidents 
and in the number of accidental injuries was also recorded in 
many oblasts, primarily Amur, Belgorod, Irkutsk, Kemerovo, 
Murmansk, Orenburg, Perm, Rostov, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, Tula, 
Chita, and Yaroslavl. 
<H5>  5.2. Natural Emergencies </H5>
  In 1992, according to the data of the Information Center of 
the Russian GKChS, there were 189 emergency situations with 
natural causes in the Russian Federation (166 in 1991), with 
4,390 victims and 86 fatalities (respective figures of 13,486 
and 112 in 1991) (Figure 5.2.1). 



  The disaster claiming the highest number of victims (934) 
was 
the epidemic of dysentery in Georgiyevsk in Stavropol Kray, and 
the majority of the victims (541) were children between the ages 
of 1 and 14. The source of the pathogen was not located. Another 
224 people, including 81 children, came down with salmonella at 
the Verkhnevolzhskaya Campgrounds (in Tver Oblast). Contaminated 
meat caused numerous cases of aphthous fever in Krasnoyarsk 
Kray, and six people came down with anthrax in Bashkortostan. 
There were numerous cases of mushroom poisoning in several parts 
of Russia. This happened to 311 people just in Voronezh Oblast, 
and 23 of them died. There were 15 cases of infectious diseases 
of agricultural livestock, including classic hog cholera 
(Kaluga, Tver, Pskov, and Volgograd oblasts). Losses of cattle 
due to disease were substantial in the Tuva Republic. 
  The most common type of natural disaster was the earthquake 
(38 in all), although the number in 1992 was not extraordinary. 
Earthquakes occurred most frequently on the Kuril Islands (12) 
and the Kamchatka Peninsula (10). Chechnya and Dagestan had 
three earthquakes each, and two were recorded in the Baykal zone. 
  Stavropol Kray suffered material losses (of around 2 million 
rubles) as a result of protracted torrential rains, hail, and 
flooding. Homes, roads, and agricultural structures were 
damaged, 40,000 hectares of grain crops were destroyed, and 
72,000 hectares of other crops were damaged. 
  In addition, 18 avalanches, 3 mudslides, and 1 landslide 
were 
recorded. The North Caucasus is the region most prone to 
avalanches: 11 were recorded in North Ossetia, and the rest 
occurred in Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, 
and Ingushetia. Avalanches have been particularly frequent in 
the Rekskiy mountain pass because of the excessive use of this 
road. Chita Oblast and Khakassia had one avalanche each. 
Although the year was close to normal in the number of 
avalanches, five people died and highways and railroads were 
obstructed. Mud slides in the North Caucasus killed three people. 
  The Russian Emergency Early Warning and Action System 
(RSChS) 
was established in 1992 for the reliable interaction of all 
government administrative bodies in emergency prevention and 
cleanup operations. This is the first attempt to define the 
functions and coordinate the actions of all government 
administrative bodies and the forces and resources under their 
jurisdiction in emergency prevention and recovery operations. 
The organization and functioning of the RSChS should secure a 
quick and efficient response to all emergency situations and the 
timely assistance of victims. 
  More than 13,000 people and more than 2,000 pieces of 
equipment of departmental units and civil defense (GO) forces 
participated in clean-up operations. Funds in excess of 5 
billion rubles were allocated for emergency grants to the 
population and priority projects. 
  The fundamentals of legislation on the protection of the 
population and territories in emergency situations were drafted 
and submitted to the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet for 
consideration in order to establish a set of legal standards in 
the protection of the population and territories from the 
effects of industrial accidents and natural disasters. These 
include laws on civil defense, the emergency rescue service, the 
status of the rescuing party, the provision of the population 
and state governing and administrative bodies with information 
about emergency situations, and industrial safety. 
  The reduction of the number and severity of the consequences 
of major accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters will 
require the following: the reorganization of existing systems 
for the forecasting and departmental monitoring of dangerous 
natural phenomena and the creation of additional systems to 
secure seismic safety; the informational linking of departmental 
monitoring systems within the framework of the Russian GKChS 
automated data management system; the reorganization of 
emergency rescue units and their provision with modern equipment. 
  These problems could be solved within the confines of 
federal 
programs for the equipping and training of emergency rescue 
units, irrespective of their departmental jurisdiction. 
<H6>  Section 6. Government Regulation of Resource Use and 
Environmental Protection </H6>
<H5>  6.1. Environmental Laws and Penalties for Violations </H5>
  Legislation in the sphere of environmental protection and 
resource use was being developed on all levels of the Russian 
Federation Government throughout 1992. 
  The Law of the RSFSR ``On the Protection of the Natural 
Environment'' went into force on 3 March 1992. In less than a 
year it played a positive role by encouraging citizens and 
public associations to be more active in the resolution of many 
environmental problems. The law also revealed many weak points 
in the state system of resource use and exposed many defects and 
shortcomings in the functioning and interaction of separate 
government agencies and the flawed and sometimes contradictory 
articles in the law itself and in other related legislative 
instruments. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Security'' was 
approved and enacted on 5 March 1992. It named environmental 
protection agencies among the forces and resources safeguarding 
national security. Ecological security issues are among the 
concerns of the Russian Federation Security Council that was 
established by this law. The heads of federal ministries and 
departments of ecology and natural resources may serve as 
council members. One of the main functions of the Russian 
Federation Security Council is the drafting of timely decisions 
on the prevention of emergency situations with major ecological 
implications and the organization of recovery operations. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Mineral Resources'' 
went into force in May 1992 and regulates relations arising 
during the process of the study, use, and protection of mineral 
resources within the territory of the Russian Federation and its 
continental shelf and maritime economic zone and the use of the 
waste products of mining industries and related processing 
production units and the extraction of peat, sapropel, and other 
specific mineral resources. 
  The law states the legal and economic fundamentals of the 
intelligent use and protection of mineral resources and protects 
the interests of the state and citizens of the Russian 
Federation and the rights of resource users. 
  The Law of the RSFSR ``On Land Fees'' went into force in 
January 1992 in accordance with an RSFSR Supreme Soviet decree 
of 11 October 1991 and underwent some revision and 
supplementation in February 1992. One of the reasons for the 
institution of land fees was the need to establish the legal 
basis of land ownership that was lacking in the Russian 
Federation Constitution and to provide incentives for the 
intelligent use and protection of land. The decrees of the 
Russian Federation Government ``On Land Monitoring'' (No 491, 15 
July 1992), ``On the Approval of the Statute on the Procedure 
for the Temporary Prohibition of the Use of Damaged Agricultural 
Lands and Lands Polluted by Toxic Industrial Waste and 
Radioactive Substances'' (No 555, 5 August 1992), ``On the 
Improvement of State Land Surveys in the Russian Federation'' 
(No 622, 25 August 1992), and ``On the Approval of the Statute 
on the Procedure for Instituting State Control Over the Use and 
Protection of Land'' (No 594, 17 August 1992) pertain directly 
to the economic aspects of land use. The last of these statutes 
identifies the government agencies specifically authorized to 
exercise state control over the use and protection of land: 
Roskomzem [Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and 
Land Management], the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology, 
the Russian Federation Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight], and Gosarkhstroynadzor 
[State Committee for Architecture and Construction Oversight], 
lists their functions and the rights and obligations of 
officials, and stipulates the procedure for collecting fines for 
violations of land laws. 
  The following legal instruments pertaining to environmental 
protection in specific regions of the Russian Federation and 
envisaging measures for the improvement and conservation of 
natural resources were enacted in 1992. 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Edict ``On the 
Protection 
of the Natural Resources of the Territorial Waters, Continental 
Shelf, and Economic Zone of the Russian Federation'' (No 436, 5 
May 1992). 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Edict ``On Natural 
Territories Under Special Protection in the Russian Federation'' 
(No 1155, 2 October 1992). 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Directive ``On Measures 
To Protect the Population and Solve Problems Connected with the 
Rising Level of the Caspian Sea'' (No 643-rp, 31 October 1992). 
  The RSFSR Government Decree ``On Immediate Measures To 
Protect the Shores of the Black and Azov Seas from Destruction 
and To Improve the Ecological State of Coastal Resort Zones in 
Krasnodar Kray'' (No 2, 2 January 1992). 
  Many of the legislative instruments of 1992 focused on the 
social protection of citizens exposed to radiation as a result 
of the disaster at the Chernobyl AES and on regulations 
governing contaminated territories: 
  The Russian Federation Government Decree ``On Measures To 
Implement the Law of the RSFSR `On the Social Protection of 
Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the 
Chernobyl AES''' (No 113, 26 February 1992). 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Amendments and 
Additions to the Law of the RSFSR `On the Social Protection of 
Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the 
Chernobyl AES''' of 18 June 1992. 
  The Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree on the 
procedure 
for enacting this law (No 3062-1, 18 June 1992). 
  The Decree of the Council of Ministers--Government of the 
Russian Federation ``On the Regulations Governing Territories 
Contaminated by Radioactive Substances as a Result of the 
Disaster at the Chernobyl AES'' (No 1008, 25 December 1992). 
  Decree No 869 of the Russian Federation Government of 12 
November 1992 ``On the State Registration of Potentially 
Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances'' was passed to 
prevent the adverse effects of potentially hazardous chemical 
and biological substances on human health and the environment. 
The decree charged the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources with 
the responsibility of keeping the federal register of 
potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances of 
natural and artificial origins. The statute does not apply to 
chemical and biological means of plant protection, plant growth 
regulators, and pharmaceuticals. 
  In addition, there were Russian Federation government 
decrees 
pertaining directly to the improvement of ecological conditions 
in the country: 
  ``On the More Effective Use of Hydrometeorological 
Information and Environmental Pollution Data in the National 
Economy'' (No 532, 3 August 1992). 
  ``On Immediate Measures To Secure the Supply of Drinking 
Water in the Russian Federation'' (No 802, 18 October 1992). 
  The following decrees of the Russian Federation Government 
pertained to the economic mechanisms of resource use: 
  ``On the Federal Ecological Fund of the Russian Federation 
and Ecological Funds Within the Territory of the Russian 
Federation'' (No 442, 29 June 1992). 
  ``On the Approval of the Procedure for Drafting and 
Approving 
the Ecological Limits on Emissions and Releases of Pollutants 
into the Environment and Limits on the Use of Natural Resources 
and the Disposal of Waste'' (No 545, 3 August 1992). 
  ``On the Approval of the Procedure for Calculating Fees and 
Maximum Payments for Environmental Pollution, Waste Disposal, 
and Other Practices with Dangerous Implications'' (No 632, 28 
August 1992). 
  The Federation Treaty Delineating the Spheres of Authority 
and Jurisdiction of Federal Government Agencies and the 
Government Agencies of Sovereign States Belonging to the Russian 
Federation, which was signed in March 1992, introduced 
substantial changes into the work of improving environmental 
protection laws. 
  According to Article 2 of the Federation Treaty and Article 
81-add of the Russian Federation Constitution, resource use, 
environmental protection, ecological safety, and environmental 
laws are under the joint jurisdiction of federal government 
agencies of the Russian Federation and the government agencies 
of the republics belonging to the Russian Federation. 
  The same articles state the procedure by which the federal 
government agencies of the Russian Federation will publish the 
fundamentals of legislation on all of the matters listed above 
to serve as a guide for the government agencies of the republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation in their own legal 
regulation, including the passage of laws and other legislative 
instruments. 
  It was on this basis that several of the republics belonging 
to the Russian Federation began drafting their own laws on 
environmental protection and related sectorial laws regulating 
the use of resources. 
  The regulation of resource use is under the joint 
jurisdiction of federal government agencies of the Russian 
Federation and the government agencies of krays, oblasts, the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the autonomous oblast, and 
autonomous okrugs belonging to the Russian Federation. 
  Government agencies of the Russian Federation will also 
publish fundamentals of legislation on these matters to serve as 
a guide for the government agencies of krays, oblasts, the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the autonomous 
territories when they exercise their own legal regulation within 
their spheres of authority by adopting legislative instruments. 
  In 1992 the administration of resource use within the 
territory of krays, oblasts, and autonomous territories was 
based on legislation of the Russian Federation, the decisions of 
kray and oblast soviets of people's deputies, and the directives 
and decrees of kray and oblast administrations. 
  The absence of a legal basis for the ownership of natural 
resources in the Russian Federation Constitution precludes the 
creation of a system of clarifying laws that do not conflict 
with one another and do meet the interests of the population of 
the whole country. 
  Terminological ambiguities create unequal relationships 
between members of the federation and could give rise to 
conflicts on various territorial-administrative levels. 
  Declarations issued by several of the republics belonging to 
the Russian Federation contained demands for the sole ownership 
of the natural resources in these republics, which would 
restrict the application of the existing Constitution of the 
Russian Federation and federal legislative instruments. 
  The absence of a procedure for enforcing certain standards 
established by law is a weak link in the existing legal system 
and is complicating relations between economic entities and 
government agencies in the sphere of resource use. The necessary 
delineation of the spheres of authority of government agencies 
in relation to economic entities is lacking. 
  Because of ambiguous wording, the duplication of powers and 
responsibilities, and the absence of clearly defined enactment 
procedures, existing laws cannot settle all of the questions 
about the legal regulation of resource use. 
  During inspections to verify the observance of environmental 
laws, state environmental oversight agencies surveyed around 
286,000 enterprises and organizations in Russia and learned that 
more than 16.6 percent were violating environmental emission and 
release standards. Administrative actions were taken against 
38,733 individuals for violations of these laws, and total fines 
exceeded 82.5 million rubles. Criminal proceedings were 
instituted against 25 individuals. 
  Fines collected for violations of environmental laws in 
1992, 
including earlier judgments, exceeded 833 million rubles, and 
the operations of more than 700 separate shops, units, and 
installations were suspended. 
  The numerous violations of regulations governing the use and 
protection of land were striking. 
  Government agencies overseeing the observance of the 
requirements of land and environmental laws conducted 90,000 
inspections of land use and environmental protection practices 
in 1992 in their spheres of authority, including 58,600 
inspections by agencies of Roskomzem, 29,400 by the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology, and 2,000 by Gosarkhstroynadzor. 
  The inspections turned up 60,800 violations covering an area 
of 1.6 million hectares. Juridical persons were responsible for 
34,900 violations covering an area of 1.584 million hectares and 
citizens committed 24,500 violations covering a total of 24,600 
hectares. The most common violations were the unauthorized 
occupation of parcels of land--31.4 percent, littering--13.9 
percent, the contamination of land--42.2 percent, and the misuse 
or destruction of the fertile layer of soil--3.6 percent. 
  When these cases were reviewed, administrative penalties 
were 
imposed on 26,700 violators, and fines totaling 359.1 million 
rubles were collected from 17,600 of them, including 188.2 
million rubles collected by agencies of Roskomzem, 167.7 million 
collected by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, and 3.2 million 
collected by the Russian Gosarkhstroynadzor. 
  Law suits for damages yielded judgments totaling 164 million 
rubles, including 111 million rubles in suits filed by agencies 
of the Russian Ministry of Ecology and 53 million in suits filed 
by Roskomzem. 
  In addition, banks stopped financing various projects 
entailing violations of existing laws and requirements with 
regard to land protection in 180 cases at the request of 
agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology (153), Roskomzem 
(21), and the Russian Gosarkhstroy [State Committee on Questions 
of Architecture and Construction] (6). 
  The files on 1,249 violations, connected primarily with the 
unauthorized occupation of land, were forwarded to investigative 
agencies, which reviewed the reports and then instituted 
criminal proceedings against 64 individuals. 
  Cases of violations were also reviewed by soviets of 
people's 
deputies, administrations, and the superiors of the 
organizations at fault at the request of agencies monitoring the 
use and protection of land, and disciplinary actions were taken 
against certain officials as a result. 
  In cases of violations of the laws on mineral resources and 
regulations and instructions on the protection of mineral 
resources, the Russian Gosgortekhnadzor suspended 1,247 projects 
and took action against 1,039 officials, including the 
collection of fines from 433. In addition, financial penalties 
were imposed on organizations for excessive losses of useful 
minerals at the request of agencies of the Russian 
Gosgortekhnadzor. 
  Forestry agencies filed claims for 1.677 million rubles in 
fines to be collected from timber users for violations during 
the year. 
  There were 126,000 violations of laws on the protection of 
fish resources in internal fisheries (with the exception of 
ponds in Dagestan and Yakutia), and the violators were fined a 
total of 67.7 million rubles. 
  In 1992 specialized maritime boards of inspection of the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology levied fines and filed claims for 
more than 44 million rubles and 25 million U.S. dollars against 
violators of environmental laws for marine pollution. 
  Inspectors of the Fishery Protection Service conducted 3,500 
inspections of Russian and foreign fishing vessels in 1992, 
discovered 458 violations of fishing regulations, and imposed 
fines and filed claims for a total of 1.9 million rubles. During 
the same period the inspectors of specialized maritime boards of 
inspection imposed fines and filed claims for a total of around 
8 billion rubles, including 650 million rubles in claims against 
the fishery protection agencies themselves, for violations of 
environmental laws in internal seas and territorial waters, on 
the continental shelf, and in the maritime economic zone of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Environmental laws are enforced by specially authorized 
agencies in the sphere of environmental protection and by the 
law enforcement agencies of internal affairs, the courts, the 
procuracy, and the arbitration courts. 
  In the environmental sphere the procuracy is empowered to 
oversee the uniform enforcement of laws by environmental 
monitoring agencies and state governing and administrative 
bodies, verify that the measures taken by these agencies against 
violators are legal and thorough, and protect the right of 
citizens to live in an ecologically healthy environment. 
  At this time 66 environmental procuracies are overseeing the 
enforcement of environmental laws. 
  In 1992 agencies of the Russian Federation Procuracy 
conducted 5,623 inspections to verify the enforcement of 
environmental laws. The results served as the basis for measures 
to eliminate violations and their causes and contributing 
factors. Requests and protests filed by procurators resulted in 
the rescission of 1,915 illegal legislative instruments, 
including 79 through people's courts. Procurators filed 3,873 
reports of violations and requested the imposition of 
disciplinary, administrative, and financial penalties on 6,300 
officials. 
  Procurators filed suits for 500 million rubles in people's 
courts and arbitration courts for compensation for the 
environmental damage caused by unlawful actions. Criminal 
proceedings were instituted against 416 people in 291 criminal 
cases of environmental pollution and violations of environmental 
laws. 
  Internal affairs agencies investigated 880 criminal cases of 
illegal fishing, sealskin trading, illegal hunting, and the 
clear-cutting of forests by 1,269 individuals and took the cases 
to court. 
  In 1992 arbitration courts in the Russian Federation settled 
5,823 disputes connected with violations of environmental laws 
(3,342 in 1991), filed claims totaling 4,509,179,000 rubles 
(292,706,000 in 1991), and actually collected 2,808,050,000 
rubles (113,729,000 in 1991). 
  The continued improvement of Russian laws and standards with 
a view to the previously mentioned Federation Treaty should lay 
the necessary legal foundation for effective activity by 
environmental protection agencies and law enforcement agencies 
on all levels in securing legality in the sphere of resource use. 
<H5>  6.2. Government Ecological Programs and Their Implementation </H5>
  The drafting and implementation of state, interstate, and 
regional ecological programs constitute one of the main 
instruments for the realization of the fundamentals of state 
policy on environmental protection and resource use. 
  In 1992 the Russian Federation had around 150 programs in 
the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource use in various 
stages of drafting and implementation. More than 70 of these 
(covering almost all of the territory of the country and drafted 
in 1990-1991) envisaged specific protective measures, some of 
which are being carried out at this time. Most of the programs 
have been financed by local budgets, ecological funds, and 
enterprise resources. 
  Ecological programs can be divided into the following groups 
in line with their objectives: 
  -- federal (interregional, international, basin, natural 
complex, etc.); 
  -- territorial (within the territorial boundaries of members 
of the federation); 
  -- natural-resource (the use and protection of water, soil, 
forests, live resources, etc.); 
  -- sectorial (the resolution of environmental problems in 
accordance with separate programs in branches of industry, in 
transportation, in agriculture, etc.); 
  Resource and sectorial programs have varying territorial 
confines. 
  A program acquires official state status after the passage 
of 
the corresponding resolution by the Supreme Soviet or the 
Russian Federation Government on its drafting and approval. 
  There are also distinctions between ecological programs 
securing the current development of economic activity in the 
society, programs for the elimination of extraordinary 
ecological situations as a result of natural disasters and 
industrial accidents or catastrophes, and programs of immediate 
measures to ensure ecological safety in a particular region or 
territory (in certain cities, for example, such as Novokuznetsk, 
Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Chelyabinsk, Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, 
and Norilsk and in the basins of the Black and Azov seas, the 
Volga River, Lake Baykal, and others). 
  The first of these have been carried out continuously 
throughout the country, with their sequence and rate of 
implementation (or order of priority) based on an analysis of 
the ecological situation in the country with a view to economic 
development, and are primarily of a preventive nature. The 
second are drafted and implemented quickly, depending on the 
severity of ecological consequences and the effects on human 
health, and the third assign priority to the improvement of the 
current grave ecological situation. This group of programs is 
most heavily dependent on strong and regular support from the 
federal budget, particularly during the initial phase of 
implementation. 
  Ecological programs are based on compromises with regard to 
the conversion to ecologically safe methods of economic activity 
for the enhancement of environmental quality and the guarantee 
of the natural development of natural objects and ecosystems 
with a view to actual capabilities and ecological consequences. 
  The procedure for drafting and implementing special federal 
programs of development in the Russian Federation and special 
interstate programs involving the Russian Federation was 
approved in 1992. In accordance with this procedure, the 
government will choose the state client for the drafting and 
implementation of the state program, with a detailed list of 
quantitative parameters, the compilation of specific plans and 
work schedules for different stages of the program, the 
development of a sophisticated mechanism for carrying out the 
program, and the choice of all the participants and the volumes 
and sources of funding for the program. Programs will be 
financed by funds from the republic budget of the Russian 
Federation and special extrabudgetary sources through the state 
clients responsible for the completion of the programs. Foreign 
investors may assist in financing the programs as partners. 
State clients will arrange for competitive bidding for each 
specific stage of the program and distribute finances among the 
parties working on each stage by signing state contracts with 
them. 
  Different branches of industry and members of the federation 
have submitted proposals to the government on the drafting and 
approval of many development programs for different fields of 
science, economic activities, and territories. The programs are 
aimed at producing qualitatively new commodities, generating 
profits, and improving social conditions for the population. The 
attainment of these objectives will contribute to environmental 
health, because the renewal of fixed assets and the move to new 
technologies should be more progressive in the ecological sense. 
Nevertheless, sectorial and administrative priorities will not 
coincide with priorities in the sphere of environmental 
protection and the intelligent use of natural resources, and the 
ecological factor is usually not the primary consideration in 
these programs. 
  In view of the limited nature of federal funds and the 
selective (or specific) approach to the choice of enterprises 
warranting state support, enterprises with adverse effects on 
natural spheres, ecosystems, and separate natural objects might 
not be included in sectorial priority projects. 
  In 1992, 14 special federal ecological programs were drafted 
and submitted for inclusion in the draft federal program for the 
restructuring of the Russian economy. The programs are listed 
below.

  (Russian Federation Government Directive No 1149-r of 5 
November 1991.) 
<H5>  6.3. Fundamental Standards and Procedures </H5>
  The fundamental standards and procedures of environmental 
protection in the Russian Federation are still being updated. 
The earlier environmental standards and rules of economic 
development, which were borrowed from various spheres and 
branches of activity, have been among the factors causing the 
present ecological crisis in the national economy of the Russian 
Federation. 
  A state ecological appraisal of existing legal standards, 
procedural instructions, and technical standards for the 
prevention of air pollution by the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
in 1992 revealed that most of these documents did not meet 
current ecological requirements, could not secure safe societal 
development, were outdated, and were of no help to a project 
planner in the advance assessment of the possible adverse 
ecological effects of economic or other decisions. Only 8 of the 
328 inspected documents in this sphere meet present 
requirements, 291 must be updated, and 29 were recommended for 
rescission by ecological experts. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Environmental 
Protection'' defines the criteria to be used in judging 
environmental quality and the ability of resource users to use 
these criteria in their economic activity. 
  The quality criteria are based on three indicators: medical 
(the maximum threat to human health and the human genetic code), 
technological (the potential to limit effects on the human being 
and the conditions of human survival), scientific-technical (the 
ability of technical equipment to monitor the observance of 
these limits in terms of all parameters). 
  Environmental standards impose requirements on the source of 
danger and limit the maximum impact. These are the standards 
defining the maximum permissible chemical, physical, biological, 
and radiation effects, emission standards, hazardous waste 
disposal standards, etc. 
  The ability of these standards to limit harmful effects is 
secured by three factors: 
  -- the correspondence of standards to the current level of 
science and technology and to international standards; 
  -- the approval of the standards by specially authorized 
government agencies; 
  -- the obligation of all economic entities to comply with 
these standards and the penalties for noncompliance by 
enterprises, organizations, and citizens. 
  The ecological requirements imposed on all economic 
structures are also reflected in the fundamental procedures of 
environmental protection. They apply to enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions, irrespective of forms of 
ownership and jurisdiction, and to citizens. Foreign juridical 
and physical persons acting as investors, entrepreneurs, and so 
forth are beginning to occupy a perceptible place among the 
parties to economic operations. In line with the move to the 
market economy, ecological requirements will be set on three 
levels: 
  -- economic entities; 
  -- stages of the economic process (project planning, siting, 
design, construction, start-up, and operation); 
  -- types of economic impact (agriculture, land reclamation, 
power engineering, urban development, etc.). 
  Experience has shown that this approach is warranted as a 
means of averting and preventing the negative ecological 
implications of various economic decisions. The observance of 
ecological safety in a projected activity will be guaranteed by 
the standards, which will prohibit the funding and 
implementation of designs and programs without a positive report 
from the State Ecological Appraisal Service. 
  Ecological requirements will extend to all economic 
activities, including the activities of military and defense 
facilities and the economic operations in free economic zones. 
Stricter ecological requirements will be the only exceptions. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology has assigned priority to the 
revision of existing procedures and the development of new basic 
procedures of environmental protection and the intelligent use 
of natural resources in line with current world standards. 
<H3>  6.4. Network of Government Bodies Regulating and Monitoring 
Resource Use and Their Activities </H3>
  There was just as much uncertainty in the system of 
management in environmental protection in 1992 as there had been 
the previous year. One of the reasons was the ``sovereignty 
war,'' just as it had been in 1991. In spite of the signed 
Federation Treaty, delineating the spheres of authority and 
jurisdiction of federal government agencies on one side, and the 
government agencies of sovereign republics belonging to the 
Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the cities of Moscow and St. 
Petersburg, the autonomous oblast, and the autonomous okrugs on 
the other, territorial officials continued to wield most of the 
influence in environmental protection agencies in 1992, and the 
vertical ties between the Russian Ministry of Ecology and 
territorial environmental protection agencies grew much weaker. 
  The main reason, however, for uncertainties with regard to 
the powers of environmental agencies, especially the Russian 
Ministry of Ecology, was that departments which had performed 
not only monitoring and administrative functions in the sphere 
of environmental protection, but also production-related 
activities (and the number of the latter is now much higher in 
the Russian Federation as a whole), were united in this ministry 
in the form of committees. This is why there was such a strong 
tendency toward their isolation as separate structures. The 
Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources was already separate 
from the Russian Ministry of Ecology at the beginning of 1992. 
  The changes did not end there. On 30 September 1992 the 
president of Russia published Edict No 1148 ``On the Structure 
of the Central Agencies of the Federal Executive Branch of 
Government'' to establish an efficient structure of central 
federal executive agencies meeting the requirements of the 
present stage of radical relations reform and to promote the 
decentralization of authority and the stronger autonomy of local 
agencies. This edict reorganized the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
as the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources and turned its committees into the Russian 
Federal Forest Service, the Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control, and the Russian 
Federal Geodesic and Cartographic Service. 
  The coordination of the activities of these agencies in 
matters under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources was 
to be the job of the Russian Federation minister of 
environmental protection and natural resources. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology spent virtually the whole 
year operating without an approved statute (a government decree 
extended the statute on the former RSFSR State Committee for 
Environmental Protection to the Russian Ministry of Ecology, but 
a statute dating back to the time when the USSR was in existence 
was ineffective under new conditions). The adoption of a new 
statute was delayed by the absence of several legislative 
instruments and by disagreements over the functions of the 
ministry in agencies of the legislative and executive branches 
of government. 
  It was not until 18 December 1992 that Russian Federation 
Government Decree No 996 approved the Statute on the Russian 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 
According to this statute, the Russian Minprirody [Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] (a central 
agency of the federal executive branch of government) and its 
local subdivisions are specially authorized state administrative 
bodies in the sphere of environmental protection. 
  The decree listed the following as the main functions of the 
Russian Minprirody: 
  -- the guarantee of comprehensive administration in the 
sphere of environmental protection and natural resources, based 
on the principles of a scientifically sound combination of the 
society's ecological and economic interests and the intelligent 
and nondepleting use of resources, and the establishment of 
environmental standards and permissible limits; 
  -- the coordination of the activities of ministries, 
departments, enterprises, institutions, and organizations in the 
sphere of environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- the pursuit of a common scientific-technical policy on 
environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- the improvement of economic, legal, and administrative 
mechanisms in the sphere of environmental protection and natural 
resources; 
  -- the organization and completion of state environmental 
impact studies; 
  -- the organization and exercise of government control in 
the 
sphere of environmental protection and the use of natural 
resources, as well as the observance of environmental safety 
standards; 
  -- the management of natural preserves in the Russian 
Federation, the supervision of entries in the Russian Red Book, 
and the organization of natural preserves; 
  -- assessments and forecasts of the state of the 
environment, 
the country's resource potential, and biosphere processes. 
  Agencies of the ministry underwent virtually no structural 
changes. In summer 1992 the 88 territorial environmental 
agencies of federation members (the federal city of St. 
Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast have a joint committee on 
ecology and natural resources), Arzamas-16, and nine specialized 
maritime boards of inspection under the direct jurisdiction of 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology had a staff of more 
than 15,500 and another 2,000 vacant positions. A random survey 
indicated that the main reason for the personnel vacancies, 
especially in inspection subdivisions and the specialized 
analytical monitoring inspectorates, was the regional shortage 
of specialists and the relatively low wages in territorial 
environmental protection agencies. 
  There were dramatic differences in the size of the staff in 
different territorial agencies: from a staff of 20-30 in the 
majority of autonomous okrugs to 300-400 or more in large 
regions with developed industry and agriculture (the Republic of 
Bashkortostan, Krasnodar and Krasnoyarsk krays, Volgograd, 
Irkutsk, Moscow, Rostov, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, the city of 
Moscow, and others). 
  Government administration of the use and protection of water 
resources, which was the responsibility of the Committee on 
Water Resources of the Russian Ministry of Ecology in 1992 in 
accordance with the Russian Federation government decree, was 
conducted on the basis of a combination of basin-management and 
territorial-administration principles. The protection of water 
resources and the monitoring of pollution in the internal seas, 
territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic 
zone of the Russian Federation had been the job of the network 
of specialized maritime boards of inspection of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology since 1990. 
  This confined the administration of the use and protection 
of 
bodies of water within their drainage basins and guaranteed the 
consideration of territorial interests. 
  In spite of frequent transformations, there were not many 
changes in the structure of the territorial agencies of other 
federal departments connected with environmental protection, the 
use of natural resources, and the guarantee of ecological 
safety. The only new element was the Russian Emergency Early 
Warning and Action System, created by the Russian Federation 
government decree for the definition of the functions and 
coordination of the actions of all state administrative bodies 
and the forces and resources under their jurisdiction in the 
prevention of emergency situations and in cleanup operations. 
  The territorial subdivisions of the Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources had 
essentially taken their final form in 1992. Each of the 51 
subdivisions had licensing departments with a staff of 5-7 
workers for the organizational support of the state mineral 
licensing system. 
  The protection of fish resources was exercised by the 
Committee of the Russian Federation on Fishing through 27 basin 
administrations and a diversified network (over 450) of fish 
conservation boards with a total staff of over 12,000. At the 
request of this committee, in 1992 the Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs took measures to intensify the struggle against 
malicious offenders and organized forms of poaching. In 
particular, federal budget funds were used to create 150 new 
staff positions in specialized subdivisions preventing unlawful 
encroachments on fisheries. Investigative agencies specializing 
in cases of poaching were created and reinforced. 
  The protection of living resources of the internal seas, 
territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic 
zone of the Russian Federation was the job of 18 specialized 
maritime inspection boards of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Ecology and 10 (of 27) basin administrations for fish 
conservation of Roskomrybolovstva [Russian Federation Committee 
on Fishing]. 
  Government oversight of the fish and other biological 
resources of internal seas, territorial waters, the economic 
zone, and the continental shelf of Russia and the open expanses 
of the World Ocean was exercised by the Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Fishing in 1992. 
  This oversight was based on the basin principle, ensuring 
consideration for the migration of fish and other marine life in 
all bodies of water, irrespective of administrative boundaries, 
in the use of marine biological resources. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation government decree, 
the reorganized Forestry Committee of the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology became the Russian Federal Forest Service. At the end of 
1992 the structure of this service included eight forestry 
ministries and 13 forest (or forestry) committees of republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation, krays and oblasts, as well 
as 1,426 tree farms and 8,000 forestry associations. The 
protection of forests from violators of forestry laws is the job 
of the State Forest Protection Service, with a staff of 98,700, 
including 56,100 forest rangers directly responsible for this 
protection. 
  The Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight has a 
service overseeing the protection of mineral resources and 
geological surveying, with a staff of around 300. 
  The creation of the network of state cadastral surveys is 
one 
of the main functions the Russian Committee on Land Reform and 
Land Resources is performing in conjunction with other specially 
authorized agencies exercising state control over the use and 
protection of land. The survey on the level of the Russian 
Federation is conducted by the central staff of Roskomzem and 
consists mainly of compilations of oblast data. 
<H5>  6.5. Economic Measures </H5>
  The eradication of the common economic zone, the increasing 
severity of the economic crisis, the destabilization of the 
financial system, the insolvency of enterprises, and the rising 
rate of inflation had a negative effect on environmental 
protection projects. 
  Capital investments in environmental protection measures 
throughout Russia in 1992 from all sources of financing came to 
almost 53 billion* rubles in current prices, which was 20 
percent* below the 1991 figure. 
  The volume of investments in the protection and reproduction 
of flora and fauna was reduced. The organization of natural 
preserves and other territories under special protection cost 34 
million* rubles, which was equivalent to only 7 percent* of the 
expenditures on these purposes in 1991 (in comparable 1992 
prices). 
  The data of Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] for 
1992 indicate that most of the investments (over 90 percent) in 
environmental protection measures came from state budgets on all 
levels and the personal resources of enterprises and 
organizations in the state sector of the economy. 
  The reduction of financing resulted in a dramatic decrease 
in 
the number of completed environmental projects. The number of 
completed facilities for the decontamination of waste gases in 
1992, for example, was equivalent to only 68 percent* of the 
number for the previous year. 
  The handling capacity of new sewage treatment facilities 
completed in 1992 amounted to 751,000* m[.sup]3[/] a day, as 
compared to 1.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] a day in 1991--i.e., 58 
percent*. The number of new municipal waste treatment facilities 
was lower than last year's by a factor of 1.7*. 
  There was a considerable decline in investments in projects 
for the efficient use and reproduction of water and land 
resources. The capacities of new water recycling systems 
amounted to 1.382 million* m[.sup]3[/] a day (36 percent* of 
the 1991 figure), and the area of reclaimed land was 4,500 
hectares smaller this year. Units were installed to trap and 
decontaminate 5.6 million* m[.sup]3[/] of waste gases an 
hour, as compared to 8.2 million* per hour in 1991. 
  These lower figures were largely a result of the inadequate 
efforts to institute the new economic-organizational mechanism 
of resource use in the past year, especially on the regional 
level. 
  The organization of records and appraisals of natural 
resources is unsatisfactory in the regions, and there are 
virtually no comprehensive land surveys. There is not enough 
coordination in the study and reproduction of resources, the 
economic regulation of the use of several types of resources is 
inadequate and, what is most important, there is no 
comprehensive management of resource use. 
  The development of the system of environmental protection 
and 
resource conservation and reproduction was impeded by delays in 
the incorporation of economic methods of management in these 
spheres. 
  The few tax benefits that were offered to enterprises and 
organizations for more active efforts in environmental 
protection did little to stimulate these efforts because of the 
negligible savings they represented. 
  Fees for environmental emissions and releases of pollutants, 
waste disposal, and other practices with harmful effects were 
the main effective economic regulator of environmental 
protection efforts in Russia in 1992. 
  The principles of the mechanism for the collection of fees 
for environmental pollution were recorded in Decree No 13 of the 
RSFSR Council of Ministers of 9 January 1991 ``On the 
Institution of Standard Fees for Environmental Emissions of 
Pollutants in 1991 and the Procedure for Collecting Them.'' In 
1992 the document was renewed for a year by Russian Federation 
Government Directive No 50-r of 9 January 1992. 
  At this time pollution fees are being paid by around 46,000 
resource users, irrespective of departmental jurisdiction, form 
of ownership, and property status: for emissions of pollutants 
from stationary and mobile sources; for the dumping of hazardous 
substances in surface and underground water; for the disposal of 
production and consumption waste. 
  The deduction of part of the amount spent by the enterprise 
or organization on environmental protection measures from the 
pollution fee was envisaged to add sufficient flexibility to the 
mechanism for the collection of the fees. Besides this, 
territorial agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
allocated resources from ecological funds to resource users for 
the financing of construction projects in environmental 
protection and other environmental projects. 
  Differentials reflecting the ecological situation and 
ecological dependence were used to adjust the standard fees in 
different regions of the Russian Federation (2 in Bashkortostan, 
1.29 in Kemerovo Oblast, and 1.1 in Omsk Oblast). 
  Agencies of the executive branch of government in republics, 
krays and oblasts, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg 
adjusted fees in 1992 in line with the ecological features of 
different regions and the economic potential of resource users. 
The fees were waived for some budget-carried organizations and 
some subdivisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Russian Ministry 
of Security, with the exception of the subdivisions engaged in 
economic activity. 
  Officials in Samara Oblast decided that up to 75 percent of 
the fees should remain at the disposal of resource users. 
Enterprises and organizations of municipal housing and public 
utilities, academic and medical establishments, and bakeries 
were exempt from pollution fees in Murmansk Oblast. 
  The sphere of application of standard fees for the dumping 
of 
sewage in Kirov Oblast was expanded by applying lower 
differentials to dumping in leach fields, storage tanks, and 
locations with certain distinctive topographical features. 
Resource users pumping liquid sewage into subterranean areas 
were granted an exemption. 
  In the Republic of Mari El fees were collected for excessive 
vehicle emissions, and North Ossetia instituted a fee for 
emissions from vehicles using natural gas. 
  Statistics for the Russian Federation as a whole in 1992 
were 
the following: 
  -- projected fees: 10 billion rubles; 
  -- fee adjustments: 4.2 billion rubles; 
  -- deductions for environmental projects: 2.6 billion 
rubles; 
  -- fees collected between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 
1992: 4.4 billion rubles. 
  The thinking of resource users had changed between 1990 and 
1992 and there were no more objections to the collection of fees 
for emissions and releases of pollutants and for waste disposal. 
  Standard fees for the environmental effects of radioactive, 
noise, and electromagnetic pollution are expected to improve the 
mechanism of pollution fees. There is a need for an economic 
mechanism of reciprocal settlements for pollutants carried 
across the border, which could be used in the calculation of 
damages in disputes between republics of the former USSR and 
settlements with foreign states. 
  Fees for the use of mineral resources, deductions for the 
reproduction, conservation, and protection of forests, and other 
types of timber fees were instituted in various regions in 1992 
in accordance with resource laws passed by the Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet. Khakassia, the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), and Belgorod, Irkutsk, Omsk, and Kostroma oblasts 
have experience in the institution of resource use fees. Fees 
for the use of certain types of natural resources have been 
instituted in all of the republics making up Russia. 
  Pursuant to Section 18 of the Law of the Russian Federation 
``On Environmental Protection,'' a draft Russian Federation 
Government Decree ``On the Approval of the Provisional Statute 
on the Procedure for Issuing Resource Use Licenses'' was 
prepared and forwarded to the Government. The draft was opposed 
by resource departments with no interest in a comprehensive 
approach to resource use. In spite of the absence of a single 
legislative instrument, many regions decided to institute the 
mechanism for the comprehensive licensing of resource use. 
  The Irkutsk Cadastre Center and the State Institute of 
Applied Ecology drafted a plan for the organization of federal 
and territorial surveys of natural resources (or objects) under 
the conditions of market relations. 
  The legal bases of incentives for resource conservation and 
environmental protection are reflected in the Law of the RSFSR 
``On the Protection of the Natural Environment'' (Section 24, 
Subsection 1). 
  It lists the following as economic incentives for 
environmental protection: enterprise profit tax credits; the 
exemption of ecological funds from taxation; ecological 
insurance; the extension of loans to enterprises, institutions, 
and citizens from ecological funds and the accelerated 
amortization of fixed capital. 
  In accordance with Russian Federation Government Directive 
No 
659-r of 5 April 1992, the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Ecology and the Russian State Insurance Company drafted and 
approved a standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance in 
the Russian Federation. 
  The voluntary form of ecological insurance is the best 
option 
today, because the mechanism for creating a state ecological 
insurance fund has not been perfected yet. Budget funds were 
allocated in the past when compulsory forms of state insurance 
were instituted. The allocation of the necessary funds from the 
federal budget to create a state ecological insurance fund would 
be extremely difficult under the conditions of the economic 
crisis in the country and the disparities in the finance and 
credit system. The premiums collected from enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations for compulsory state insurance 
would be included in the overhead costs of production, and this 
could lead to a further rise in prices and inflationary 
processes. 
  Using the standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance 
in the Russian Federation as a guide, the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology worked with the Tyumen Oblast Committee and the Dobryy 
Den Insurance Company on the drafting of ecological insurance 
regulations and defined the basic guidelines of insurance 
operations and prospects for cooperation by environmental 
protection organizations with the insurance company. This 
insurance company is now considering applications for insurance 
on pipelines and oil tanks of the Surgutneftegaz and 
Yuganskneftegaz associations. 
  The Ecological Hazard Insurance Center of the ASKO-Moskva 
Insurance Company has some experience with voluntary ecological 
insurance. This company has insured two pipelines (for 18 
million and 20 million rubles), two oil terminals (3 million and 
6 million), and a joint-stock company (10 million rubles) 
against ecological hazards in line with its regulations of civil 
liability insurance for environmental damage. 
  In the future the Ivanovskiy Ecological Insurance Fund, a 
joint-stock company of the closed type, the Viktoriya 
Joint-Stock Insurance Company, the Triada, Belogorye, and 
Uverennost insurance companies, and others plan to offer 
voluntary ecological insurance (after they have drafted their 
regulations and received the appropriate licenses). 
  During the stabilization of economic conditions in the 
country, the reinforcement of the finance and credit system, and 
the testing of the mechanism of voluntary ecological insurance, 
the feasibility of compulsory insurance can be considered while 
the procedural documents on this kind of insurance are being 
drafted. 
  The development of the actual mechanism of compulsory 
ecological insurance should include the determination of the 
specific branches, subbranches, and enterprises where it will be 
instituted; the preparation of several sectorial procedural 
documents on ecological insurance; the creation of the necessary 
statistical database on ecological hazards, accidents, and 
disasters (and the resulting losses) for at least the last five 
years; the calculation of insurance premiums for different 
fields of activity and objects of insurance. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology drafted documents on 
economic 
incentives for environmental protection, including the draft law 
of the Russian Federation ``On Amendments and Additions to 
Russian Federation Laws on Taxation,'' and submitted these 
documents to the government. 
  The law envisages tax exemptions (value-added tax, profit 
tax, and property tax) for extrabudgetary state ecological 
funds, tax exemptions (value-added tax and profit tax) for state 
natural preserves, national parks, and botanical gardens, and 
larger tax deductions for enterprise profits used in 
environmental projects. Measures to provide economic incentives 
for the intelligent use of resources in the future include the 
establishment of higher amortization rates for 
resource-conserving fixed productive assets, the supplementary 
taxation of ecologically harmful products and goods (or work and 
services), the institution of price and surcharge incentives for 
ecologically acceptable products for enterprises and for the 
juridical and physical persons producing goods (or work and 
services) for ecological purposes, and the accumulation of 
ecological bank resources for the crediting of environmental 
projects. Under the conditions of the move to new economic 
relations, the granting of broader powers to agencies of local 
government and self-government, and the atmosphere of political 
and economic instability, the state has ceased to be responsible 
for economic decisions and to serve as the guarantor of the 
economic development of many enterprises. This means that they 
have to find their own ways of dealing with problems connected 
with the institution of market relations. If we consider that 
environmental protection costs were previously funded primarily 
in line with a plan and mainly with budget funds, this factor 
could give rise to uncontrollable negative changes in the 
ecological situation. This could be prevented by developing a 
market for ecological work and services and establishing a 
flexible mechanism of interaction by market structures in the 
environmental sphere, government bodies, and environmental 
protection agencies. 
  There is virtually no regulation of the market for 
ecological 
work and services at this time, and there are no fundamental 
laws and standards governing its establishment and functioning. 
  The market is developing in a haphazard manner, mainly 
through indirect channels connected with natural and secondary 
resources and their deliveries to foreign countries. Ecological 
work and services aimed directly at the attainment of 
environmental protection objectives and the ecologization of 
production have not displayed much development. 
  Meanwhile, several existing and projected commercial 
structures and public organizations are trying to take on the 
functions of monitoring, coordination, licensing, the 
organization of environmental impact studies, and the 
institution of environmental standards, which could lower the 
level of government regulation of environmental quality and 
resource use and result in the monopolization of the market for 
ecological services by structures of this kind. 
  A draft plan for the development of the market for 
ecological 
work and services and documents on the progress in developing a 
market for ecological work and services were prepared and 
submitted to the Committee of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet on Ecology and Resource Conservation. The documents were 
discussed and approved at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet 
committee (Resolution No 56 of 23 January 1992). In accordance 
with this decision, proposals were prepared with regard to a 
program of support for economic activities and the improvement 
of legislation with the aim of developing a market for 
ecological work and services. 
  A special section on ``The Ecological Safety of 
Entrepreneurship and the Production of Goods (or Work and 
Services) of an Ecological Nature'' was drafted and included in 
the comprehensive program for the development of 
entrepreneurship in Russia. 
  The ``Agreement on Interaction by the Russian Minprirody and 
Russian Gosstandart [Committee on Standardization, Metrology, 
and Certification] in Standardization, Metrology, and 
Certification Operations Connected with the Regulation of the 
Use of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection, and the 
Ecological Safety of Products and Technological Processes'' was 
correlated and approved. 
  Several new subdivisions were established for the 
comprehensive introduction of the regional economic mechanism of 
resource use: a resource survey enterprise (the ``Kadastr'' NPP 
[scientific-production association] in Yaroslavl), the 
Scientific Research Center of Resource Surveys (the ``Kadastr'' 
NITs [scientific research center] in Irkutsk), the Scientific 
Research and Coordinating Center for Ecological Safety and 
Market Management (the ``Ekobezopasnost'' NITs), and the 
Volga-Vyatka regional branch of the Scientific Research and 
Coordinating Center of the ``Ekobezopasnost'' NIT's. 
  All of these scientific subdivisions became structural 
elements of institutes of the Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation government decree 
on the federal ecological fund, the following were drafted by 
the Russian Ministry of Ecology and Russian Ministry of Finance 
and approved following consultations with the Russian Central 
Bank: a standard statute on ecological funds within the 
territory of the Russian Federation and the procedure for 
collecting contributions from enterprises, institutions, 
organizations, citizens, and foreign juridical persons and 
citizens for state extrabudgetary ecological funds. 
  The distributors of fund resources, the procedure for 
collecting and using these resources, and the legal bases of the 
establishment and functioning of the directors and boards of 
funds with the status of juridical persons were determined on 
the regional level in accordance with approved legislative and 
administrative documents. 
  The reduction of resources from traditional sources of 
funding will enhance the role of the ecological funds, but the 
economic difficulties of enterprises, which are affecting their 
solvency, the rapid rise in the cost of work and services, which 
is far in excess of the rate of monetary accumulations in the 
funds, the devaluation of these resources as a result of the 
long time interval between the institution of the fees and their 
collection and use, and the low level of financial discipline 
have reduced the impact of the use of fund resources in several 
cases. 
  The cost of work and services financed by enterprise 
contributions accumulated in the funds--i.e., by the taxable 
portion of the overhead cost of products or the sum paid out of 
enterprise net profits--rose 28 percent in 1991. This removed 
one-third of the profits earmarked for reinvestment from the 
environmental investment cycle, which is unacceptable under the 
conditions of galloping inflation. All of this weakened 
incentives for environmental projects, held up the growth of 
potential credit resources, and impeded the calculation of 
preferential interest rates for enterprise loans. 
  According to statistical reports, the amount deposited in 
ecological funds in the Russian Federation in 1992 was 
7,718,200,000 rubles. 
  The money was used mainly for the following (in 
percentages): 
  -- environmental construction projects--26.6; 
  -- scientific research and design projects--10.0; 
  -- participation in the development of the material and 
technical base of local environmental protection agencies--16.4; 
  -- credits and loans for construction, retooling, 
renovation, 
and capital repairs--5.6; 
  -- monitoring--3.5; 
  -- other expenditures--19.8. 
  Ecological funds in Russia contributed only 3.1 percent of 
their resources, instead of the projected 10 percent, to the 
federal ecological fund. 
  The situation was the following in absolute figures: The 
federal fund should have received around 763.3 million rubles, 
but actually received 158.6 million, or 604.6 million rubles 
(79.2 percent) less than expected. 
  The accumulation of resources and the regularity of 
contributions to ecological funds are being impeded by the 
skewed nature of the legally secured procedure for the 
collection of fees, because it obligates the enterprise to pay, 
but does not provide for the collection of fees by specially 
authorized agencies in the event of the enterprise's refusal to 
pay, which would require the inclusion of a mandatory collection 
provision in the law. 
  This is slowing down the creation of state ecological funds 
based on common principles of organizational management, 
planning, communication between funds on different levels, the 
mechanism of implementation and control, decisionmaking 
procedures, and reliable reports. 
  The information received from 52 regional environmental 
protection committees representing members of the federation 
indicates that 44 state ecological funds have bank accounts and 
only 7 organizations have the rights of a juridical person. 
  The functions of this fund are performed by soviets of 
people's deputies, local administrations, and environmental 
protection committees (Table 6.5.1--see ZELENYY MIR, p 12).

  Besides this, the oversight of fund activities is exercised 
in two cases by environmental protection committees in 
conjunction with soviets and the administration, in six cases by 
the committee and the administration, in two cases by the 
soviets and the administration, and in two cases by all three 
functional bodies. 
  Because the law does not define the specific procedure for 
the payment of fees by enterprises, it would be wise to add a 
description of the mechanism, approved by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Finance and Russian Federation Minprirody after 
consultations with the Russian Federation Central Bank, for the 
transfer of money by enterprises, institutions, organizations, 
citizens, and foreign juridical persons and citizens to state 
ecological funds. Besides this, the delineation of ownership 
rights to natural resources could serve as the basis for 
legislative definitions of different ratios in the distribution 
of federal property fees among funds on various levels. The 
abovementioned ``Procedure for the Collection of Contributions 
to State Funds,'' drafted with the participation of the 
executive board of directors of the RF Federal Ecological Fund, 
and state statistical report form No 1-Ecofund on the creation 
and use of fund resources, approved by the Russian Goskomstat, 
should reinforce the legal standards and information base of 
fund management. 
  Existing laws and legislative instruments regulating 
privatization say virtually nothing about environmental 
protection. For this reason, in 1992 the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology drafted a supplement to the draft state privatization 
program for 1993, in accordance with which the privatization of 
ecologically hazardous enterprises should be conditional upon 
the completion of programs for the improvement of ecological 
conditions at these enterprises and the creation of special 
ecological sanitation funds. The Russian Ministry of Ecology and 
Goskomimushchestvo [RF State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property] will establish the procedure for considering the 
ecological factor in the privatization of state and municipal 
enterprises in 1993, including ecological appraisals, the 
inclusion of requirements pertaining to the ecological 
sanitation of enterprises in the terms of competitive bidding 
and in privatization plans, the assignment of higher values to 
environmental protection assets, and the creation of ecological 
sanitation funds at enterprises. 
<H5>  6.6. State Environmental Impact Studies </H5>
  Environmental impact studies will be conducted during the 
drafting and substantiation of decisions on the socioeconomic 
development of the country, separate regions, branches, and 
enterprises for the purpose of preventive ecological control and 
the guarantee of ecological safety. 
  They will be conducted by the State Ecological Appraisal 
Service, uniting 88 territorial appraisal subdivisions, the Main 
Administration of State Ecological Appraisals and the State 
Council of Experts on Ecology and Natural Resources of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology. They have a combined 
staff of 650. 
  Territorial and federal agencies of the state ecological 
appraisal network have requested well-known scientists and 
highly skilled specialists in all branches of the national 
economy to take part in comprehensive environmental impact 
studies of various national economic projects. In 1992, for 
example, they enlisted the help of more than 10,000 independent 
experts. 
  Public environmental impact studies must be considered 
during 
the discussion of projects at meetings of the State Council of 
Experts, and the results of these studies are considered at the 
same time as the results of the work of the expert commissions 
formed by the State Ecological Appraisal Service. Meetings of 
the State Council of Experts of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
and territorial councils of ecological experts have been open to 
the general public and to organizations with an interest in 
specific projects. 
  The distribution of projects considered by the State 
Ecological Appraisal Service in 1992 among branches of the 
national economy was the following: 45 percent in agriculture 
and water management, 38 percent in industry, and 17 percent in 
other branches. 
  In all, the service reviewed 56,000 different documents, 
with 
a combined estimated completion cost of 462 billion rubles (in 
1990-91 prices), recommending the implementation of 70 percent, 
rejecting 9 percent, and returning 21 percent for revisions (33 
percent were not approved in 1991). 
  The Main Administration of State Ecological Appraisals of 
the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology conducted environmental 
impact studies of projects and measures on the federal level 
which could affect the interests of the Russian Federation and 
neighboring states or the interests of two or more republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation and documents substantiating 
the declaration of ecological emergencies and ecological 
disaster zones in certain territories. 
  In 1992 the main administration reviewed 167 different 
documents, including three state programs (with a combined cost 
of 99 billion rubles): 
  -- the Unified State Program for the Protection of the 
Population of the Russian Federation from the After-Effects of 
the Chernobyl Disaster in 1992-95 and During the Period up to 
2000; 
  -- the Russian State Program for the Handling of Radioactive 
Waste and Spent Nuclear Materials; 
  -- the State Program of the Russian Federation for the 
Reclamation of Contaminated Territories in the Ural Region. 
  The main difficulties in the work of the appraisal service 
are connected with the following: 
  -- the shortage of standards and procedural instructions on 
the drafting, coordination, and approval of planning documents 
during different stages of the investment process; 
  -- discrepancies between the requirements of procedural 
instructions and the planning requirements of legislative 
instruments; 
  -- the absence of procedural documents for the 
identification 
of sectorial features of the environmental impact of economic 
and other activity. 
  In connection with all of this, the State Ecological 
Appraisal Service began working on a set of procedural 
instructions for environmental impact studies in 1992, 
specifically for the purpose of establishing more distinct and 
precise requirements with regard to the composition, format, and 
content of materials for the ecological substantiation of 
projects. The Main Administration of State Ecological Appraisals 
drafted the following: ``Temporary Instructions on the 
Ecological Substantiation of Economic Activity in Pre-Planning 
and Planning Documents'' and the ``Temporary Procedure for the 
Submission of Cost Estimates and Payment Invoices for Expert 
Work and Services Performed by the Main Administration of State 
Ecological Appraisals.'' 
  The service also continued its efforts to arrange for the 
advanced training of the personnel of appraisal subdivisions of 
territorial agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, the 
computerization of appraisals, and the development of an 
automated appraisal network. 
  At this time, 61 percent of the appraisal subdivisions have 
been equipped with computers. The improvement of programs and 
the supplementation of the database will facilitate the work of 
the experts. The development of the procedural and technical 
base of appraisal agencies was made possible by the move to 
contracted appraisals in 1992, which are now being conducted by 
67 territorial agencies. 
<H5>  6.7. Environmental Monitoring </H5>
  Several departmental monitoring services are already 
operating in the Russian Federation. The most prominent of these 
are the following: 
  -- the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] service; 
  -- the forest monitoring service of Rosleskhoz [Russian 
Federal Forest Service]; 
  -- the water resource monitoring service of Rosvodkhoz 
[Russian Water Resource Management Service]; 
  -- the geological monitoring system of Geokom [Russian 
Geological Committee]; 
  -- the agrochemical observation and soil pollution 
monitoring 
service of Minselkhoz [RF Ministry of Agriculture]; 
  -- the land monitoring system of Roskomzem; 
  -- the human habitat and human health monitoring service of 
Gossanepidnadzor; 
  -- the monitoring and inspection service of Minprirody. 
  These monitoring services and systems observe and assess the 
state of various elements of the environment and natural 
resources. Each of these systems operates according to its own 
program, which is virtually uncoordinated with other programs. 
  The presently operating environmental monitoring service of 
Rosgidromet is expected to keep records of the physical, 
chemical, and hydrobiological (for water) indicators of levels 
of pollution in the atmosphere, soil, water, and sediment of 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and seas in order to study the spread 
of pollutants in time and space, assess and predict the state of 
the environment, and judge the effectiveness of protective 
measures. 
  At this time there is no forest monitoring system gathering 
and processing data on all of Russia's forests. Most of the 
information is collected by the administrators of timber assets 
during the compilation of state statistical reports and during 
forestry research and restoration projects. 
<H5>  [No 26, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  While the majority of European countries now have national 
forest monitoring systems and systems for the regular collection 
of information, the state of forests in the Russian Federation 
is monitored only in Kaliningrad and Leningrad oblasts and in 
part of Tula Oblast. 
  The establishment of a Roskomvod computer network for the 
quick and efficient collection, processing, and storage of data 
and the transmission of data to concerned organizations for 
decisions on branch management is an essential part of the 
monitoring system. To this end, an information program was 
drafted at the request of Roskomvod and distributed to all basin 
water management agencies for the organization of the state 
water cadastre to provide the committee's basin and territorial 
agencies, organizations in the ecological resource field, and 
local executive agencies with reports on the use of water 
resources. 
  The Russian Federation Geological Service has 60 specialized 
hydrogeological and geological engineering units to monitor 
geological conditions. The observation network includes around 
18,000 wells and several dozen test sites for the study of the 
current state of ground water (the depletion of reserves, the 
quality of ground water, the flooding of territories, and the 
salinization of soil), around 15,000 centers to monitor 
dangerous exogenous geological processes (landslides, karsts, 
mud slides, attrition, thermal karsts, and others), and 27 
earthquake prediction centers. 
  The absence of standard monitoring requirements and a common 
set of standards governing measurements and the transmission of 
data gathered during observations creates serious problems in 
the collection and integration of information. As a result, the 
possibility of obtaining comprehensive assessments of ecological 
conditions within the territory of Russia becomes improbable. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology has worked with 
concerned ministries and departments to organize the Unified 
Russian State Ecological Monitoring System (YeGSEM). 
  The YeGSEM was established primarily to obtain complete and 
accurate information about ecological conditions within the 
territory of Russia--information needed by state administrative 
bodies in the sphere of environmental protection and natural 
resources, resource users, and the public. 
  The YeGSEM was established on the basis of existing 
departmental systems for the observation and monitoring of the 
state of the environment, natural objects, and sources of 
anthropogenic influences. 
  This has been part of the general change in organizational 
principles, procedures, and standards and measures, and of the 
creation of a mechanism for interaction by departmental 
services, without any disruption of the existing structure of 
administrative agencies. 
  At this time the Russian Ministry of Ecology is working with 
Rosgidromet, the Russian Minatom [RF Ministry of Atomic Energy], 
and several other agencies on the draft decree of the Russian 
Federation Government on ``The Establishment of a Single State 
Ecological Monitoring System in the Russian Federation.'' 
<H5>  6.8. Environmental Security System </H5>
  In accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation ``On 
Security'' and pursuant to the decree of the Russian Federation 
Government ``On the Creation of the Russian Emergency Early 
Warning and Action System (RSChS),'' the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Ecology drew up a plan for the ecologically safe 
development of Russia. This plan has served as a basis for the 
statute on the ecological safety subsystem of the RSChS, 
designed to anticipate ecological emergencies, disasters, and 
catastrophes and to safeguard the ecological security of the 
population and reduce damages to natural resources in the event 
of such emergencies. 
  The subsystem was based on a set of modules, serving as 
regional links of the ecological security network, in constant 
contact with superior agencies of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Ecology. The establishment of the subsystem was 
begun in December 1992 and has been carried out on two levels. 
  A Main Administration for Ecological Security was 
established 
as part of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, and a federal 
computerized system of information analysis--the Federal 
Information Analysis Center (FIATs)--is being established in the 
State Institute of Applied Ecology (GIPE). On the regional level 
an ecological security module has been established in Arzamas-16 
to serve that city and the surrounding territory, distinguished 
by a high concentration of sources of ecological hazards and 
hazardous technology. The functioning of the ``Ekologiya'' 
regional information analysis center (RIATs) will be tested 
there. 
  The specific structure of territorial links of the 
ecological 
security network will be decided by the corresponding 
environmental agencies on the local level in close interaction 
with territorial emergency management commissions of the Russian 
GKChS. 
  The main functions of the ecological security subsystem will 
be the following: 
  -- the formulation and pursuit of a single state policy on 
ecological security within the territory of the Russian 
Federation; 
  -- the forecasting of possible ecological emergencies and 
their implications; 
  -- the organization and management of a statewide 
environmental monitoring system, using the data of existing 
federal oversight and control services; 
  -- the procedural supervision of territorial environmental 
agencies in emergency situations and in cleanup operations 
following ecological emergencies; 
  -- the organization and coordination of emergency preventive 
services and the cleanup operations following ecological 
emergencies; 
  -- the organization and supervision of the system for the 
ecological protection of the territory of the Russian Federation 
from biological pollutants crossing the border and spreading 
through this territory; 
  -- the organization and supervision of an advanced training 
and certification system for administrative personnel and 
specialists in the sphere of ecological security. 
  The main agency of the subsystem will be the Commission on 
Ecological Emergencies and Ecological Security of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology, headed by the first deputy 
minister. The commission's main functions will be defined in 
line with the objectives of the RSChS subsystem. They will 
include the drafting of recommendations for the improvement of 
the criteria used in the designation of certain territories and 
bodies of water in the Russian Federation as ecological 
emergency zones or ecological disaster zones, the coordination 
and organization of work on the quick and efficient diagnosis of 
ecological problems in specific territories, and the compilation 
of reports in conjunction with the Main Ecological Appraisal 
Administration on the recognition (or nonrecognition) of these 
territories as ecological disaster zones or ecological emergency 
zones. 
  The creation of a functional ecological security subsystem, 
which the country did not have in the past, is certain to 
require sizable expenditures, substantial investments of 
material and technical resources, the training of specialists in 
this field, and so forth, which will entail major difficulties 
now that Russia has entered a complex transition period. 
  The search for alternatives has led to suggestions to make 
use of the potential of existing structures--for example, by 
adapting (or converting) the existing organization of radiation, 
chemical, and biological defense forces of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Defense. 
  The projected downsizing of the armed forces, which would 
involve not only the dismissal of specialists, but also the 
reduced production of protective, diagnostic, and processing 
equipment and so forth, is another argument in favor of this 
option. 
<H6>  Section 7. Science and Technology in the Resolution of 
Environmental Problems </H6>
<H5>  7.1. Scientific-Technical Development Projects </H5>
  Scientific and technical projects in the ecological sphere 
focused on the formulation of a common scientific and technical 
policy on ecology and were carried out within the following 
basic organizational formats: 
  -- the ``Russia's Ecology'' scientific and technical program 
(Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology); 
  -- state scientific and technical programs in ecological 
fields (Russian Federation Ministry of Science); 
  -- sectorial and intersectorial research and design projects 
(state orders) of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science; 
  -- basic ecological research projects of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences; 
  -- ecological research and development projects of 
departmental research institutes in various fields; 
  -- ecological research projects conducted in Russia's 
leading 
higher academic institutions. 
  The present methods of organizing scientific research give 
rise to major difficulties in the coordination of all of the 
programs pertaining to environmental subjects, in the scientific 
generalization of research findings, and in the move to 
development projects. 
  The ``Russia's Ecology'' program, which was drawn up in 1992 
by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, was intended primarily to 
define the conceptual, methodological, and procedural bases of 
standards, laws, and the economic, informational, and 
organizational premises of ecologically sound resource use. 
Around 400 projects have been carried out within the framework 
of the program, with total funding estimated at 160 million 
rubles. The resulting information will be collated and will then 
be reported to the scientific community. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology also drew up the 
major special federal program known as ``Russian Ecological 
Security,'' the purpose of which is the scientific reinforcement 
of Russia's ecological security during the development of the 
market economy and the establishment of the Russian Government 
by concentrating the efforts of scientists and other experts in 
fields in which the genuine need for certain scientific and 
technical products is already recognized by the future consumer. 
Virtually all regions of Russia took part in drawing up the 
program. Regrettably, the program does not include enough of the 
major projects that should have represented special ``state 
orders'' from the federal government. 
  The scientific research conducted within the framework of 
the 
state scientific and technical programs (GNTP) in ecological 
fields of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science is intended 
to reduce adverse effects on the environment and design 
technologies and processes securing the ecologically safe 
functioning and growth of the branches most responsible for 
environmental pollution. 
  A list of GNTP's with clearly ecological aims and some 
additional information about these programs are presented in 
Table 7.1.1. The purpose of all these programs is the planning 
of a Russian ecological policy to secure the stable development 
of the economy and the establishment and reinforcement of 
ecological harmony, ecological safety, and healthy living 
conditions for the human beings within the territory of our 
country.

  As Table 7.1.1. (see page 5 of ZELENYY MIR) indicates, the 
combined funding for ecological research just within the 
confines of these programs exceeded 3 billion rubles in 1992. 
  The projects produced many concrete and positive results and 
led to the actual implementation of these findings in mock-ups, 
test samples, and experimental models of new equipment, 
technology, and materials. The ``Comprehensive Studies of Oceans 
and Seas, the Arctic Zone, and Antarctica'' GNTP, for example, 
led to new theories about the distinctive features of water 
currents in the coastal zone of the Black Sea, which has been 
exposed to maximum anthropogenic pressure, and permitted 
assessments of the self-cleansing properties of the Black Sea. 
  A map of the regional flora and fauna of the Kara, White, 
and 
Black Sea coastal zones, influenced by anthropogenic factors, 
has been compiled. An ecological monitoring program was drawn up 
for the site of the projected exploitation of oil and gas 
deposits in the Kara Sea for subsequent assessments of 
environmental damage. Problems in international navigation and 
the development of foreign economic shipping were analyzed on 
the levels of theory and practice, the principal means and 
methods of securing Russia's interests in the world ocean were 
determined, and the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law 
of the Sea were analyzed in depth. Considerable attention was 
paid to the problem of the delimitation of sea boundaries and 
the regulation of conflicts in the management of the biological 
resources of the open seas. 
  The ``Global Changes in the Environment and Climate'' GNTP 
calculated the degree of bogging in Russian territories. Studies 
indicated that 40-50 million tonnes of atmospheric carbons are 
combined and deposited in bogs each year, representing 6-8 
percent of the technogenic emissions of carbon dioxide in all of 
Russia. Because of global warming, the combined carbons will be 
released primarily from the shallow peat soils of the forest 
zone, where the processes of bog formation are constantly 
fluctuating. 
  Principles and methods of studying the evolution of soils 
under the influence of global changes in the climate have been 
elaborated. 
  Projections of changes in the Siberian landscape and climate 
by the year 2000, based on the theory of paleoclimatic analogies 
and on calculations of concentrations of carbon monoxide, have 
been published. 
  Assessments of the prospects of the mineral and raw material 
complex and measures for its reorganization at a time of changes 
in the climate and environment will be of great value to the 
national economy. 
  In the sphere of short-term forecasts of changes in climate, 
greenhouse gas emissions and projected emissions throughout 
Russia and industrial leaks of methane were calculated. These 
calculations, which were once based on inventory reports, were 
conducted for all of Russian territory for the first time. 
  The ``Safety of the Population and National Economic 
Facilities in View of the Risk of Natural and Technogenic 
Disasters'' GNTP resulted in the development of probability 
models to assess the risk of accidents and disasters and the 
formulation of criteria and requirements of the survivability 
and reliability of ecologically hazardous technical facilities. 
A report was submitted on ``The State of Geological Conditions 
in the City of Moscow, with an Emphasis on the Territories 
Posing Potential Threats to the Normal Existence of the City,'' 
the first map of the geo-ecological hazards was compiled, 
marking the dangerous and potentially dangerous districts, 
constituting 60 percent of the city's territory, and a program 
was drawn up for future comprehensive geological engineering 
studies for the more efficient use of territory in the city of 
Moscow. 
  The first map depicting ``The Probability of Ecological 
Emergencies Within the Territory of Russia'' (scale 1:800,000) 
was compiled. 
  The ``High-Efficiency Food Production'' GNTP led to the 
development of fundamentally new technologies for the 
cultivation of agricultural crops, particularly the raising of 
rice in ordinary irrigated areas without the costly features of 
traditional rice paddies, reducing water requirements to 
one-fifth of the previous figure. 
  The ``Ecologically Clean Rapid Transit'' program envisages 
the development of models--vehicle prototypes with new types of 
engines, antitoxic devices, and new structural materials, which 
should reduce the adverse environmental effects of motor 
vehicles. A domestic commuter train with speeds of up to 350 
km/hr was tested successfully in 1992. 
  The most significant results of the ``Latest Bio-Engineering 
Methods'' program included a set of regional procedures for 
judging the potential environmental impact by the content of the 
main types of toxic compounds released into the soil and water 
as a result of industrial and agricultural activity. Genetic 
engineering produced strains of bacteria for the degradation of 
organochlorine compounds. 
  One example of a large-scale and highly effective advanced 
development project in the ``Ecologically Clean Power 
Engineering'' program was the study of the possibility of 
building a highly safe nuclear power plant with an average 
capacity of 600,000 kilowatts (electrical) with a water-cooled, 
enhanced-safety, power reactor (VPBER). Nuclear power plants and 
nuclear heat and power substations with reactors of this type 
would be much safer than all existing nuclear power units and 
all of the units being developed currently in the world. Because 
of this, they have aroused considerable interest in the United 
States and several European countries. 
  Scientific research and development projects were also 
carried out in 1992 as part of certain major research and design 
projects of a sectorial or intersectorial nature for the 
development of new generations of equipment, technology, and 
materials to expand the scales of resource-conserving and 
ecologically clean basic technologies. 
  Ninety such projects were financed by the Russian Ministry 
of 
Science's Fund for Major National Economic Problems in 1992, 
with total allocations reaching 340.105 million rubles. 
  The basic ecological research of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences was conducted in a series of pioneering projects, 
despite the suspension of financing for the academy's Biosphere 
and Ecology research program and the sharp cuts in basic 
funding. Priority continued to be assigned to basic ecological 
science, focusing on the resolution of environmental problems, 
the development of theories with regard to the main groups of 
problems, the analysis of scientific, technical, and 
technological achievements and world experience in the 
resolution of environmental problems and the attainment of 
sustainable development, and the disclosure of inadequately 
investigated priority fields (for example, the economics of 
sustainable development). 
  Important results were achieved in many fields of basic 
science. The field of physico-technical sciences and 
mathematics, for example, produced a plan for the safe 
development of nuclear power engineering in Russia. A theory of 
the nuclear safety of fission reactors was formulated. Proposals 
were drawn up on the enhancement of the safety of existing and 
projected nuclear power plants, and groups of computer programs 
(or codes) were developed to analyze their safety. The possible 
scales of the use of nuclear power engineering in the 21st 
century were assessed. 
  A project was conducted for the scientific substantiation of 
a new generation of steam and gas power plants operating on 
natural gas, with a cooling system distinguished by superior 
efficiency and ecological indicators. 
  The plans and technological recommendations for ecologically 
clean technological units for TES [thermal electric power plant] 
with plasmothermal gasification were drawn up. A decision was 
made to build an experimental unit at the Berezovskaya GRES 
[state regional electric power station]-1 (Kuybyshev Electrical 
Equipment Plant). 
  A unique method of protecting the earth's atmosphere from 
freon emissions with the aid of an SHF discharge has been 
proposed. The composition of the products of freon 
disintegration has been defined, and their safety for the ozone 
layer has been demonstrated. A plasmochemical microwave reactor 
is being designed to transform ozone-destroying freons into 
ecologically harmless modifications. 
  Basic plans for waste-free technology in petroleum 
production 
and the extraction of natural bitumen with heat processing and a 
technological power unit for their implementation have been 
proposed. 
  New generations of unique ecological procedures, methods, 
instruments, and systems of environmental control have been 
developed: 
  -- automated analytical systems for the control of the 
ecological state of bodies of water have been designed; 
  -- sonar tracking is being used to study the meteorological 
conditions of the diffusion of pollutants in big cities; 
  -- a highly sensitive, all-purpose gas chromatograph with 
ionization detectors, the ``KhDI,'' has been developed for air, 
water, and soil pollution control; 
  -- a new, highly precise method has been developed for the 
measurement of trace elements of aromatic chlorine compounds and 
dioxins in natural objects with photoionization mass 
spectrometry; 
  -- methods have been developed for the hydrosol-beam 
treatment of the waste gases of TES to remove mixtures of 
nitrogen and sulfur oxides with an electron beam and acid salt 
agents. 
  In the chemical and technological sciences, projects have 
been launched to develop low-waste technologies for the refining 
of oil and gas, the processing of coal, the removal of 
tetraethyl lead from gasoline, the establishment of ecologically 
acceptable pulp and paper production units, and the development 
of intensive (1.3-1.5 times the present rate) biological and 
biochemical sewage treatment systems. 
  A computerized accident analysis system has been proposed 
for 
facilities of the gas-chemical industry to determine the 
potentially most hazardous elements of the technological process 
and to predict the effects and define the causes of accidents. 
  A comprehensive approach to the development of ecologically 
clean fire- and explosion-proof methods of processing and 
disposing of the compacted industrial waste of the 
medical-biological industry and waste agricultural chemicals and 
pesticides have been proposed. 
  Chemical and physico-chemical methods have been proposed for 
the reclamation of land damaged by rocket fuel components. 
  The use of the ``Akromidan-LK'' cation flocculant has been 
proposed for sewage treatment in big cities. 
  Sewage treatment and decontamination equipment using 
accelerated electrons has been developed, and the nature of the 
products of the radiolytic decomposition of organic chlorine 
compounds in aqueous solutions has been studied. 
  Methods have been proposed for the sorption-hydrolytic 
treatment of galvanic waste for the removal of nonferrous metals. 
  Waste-free methods of recycling used catalytic agents 
containing nonferrous metals have been proposed. 
  Years of research have resulted in the proposal of a 
microbiological method of eliminating petroleum pollution in 
water and soil by using hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms. 
The industrial production of the microbe compounds has been 
organized. 
  A bioelectrochemical method has been developed to monitor 
the 
phenol content of different types of water. 
  In the biological sciences, special attention has been paid 
to the analysis and assessment of the present state of Russia's 
biological resources, the elaboration of the scientific bases 
for their intelligent, nondepleting use, the preservation of 
biological diversity, the prevention of the deterioration of the 
gene pool, and the preservation of our natural legacy. 
  A computer database on the biodiversity of ecosystems is 
being compiled. The functional-structural organization of 
ecosystems has been chosen as the priority characteristic. 
  A database has been created for state records of wooded 
areas 
in Siberia and the Far East. 
  Monitoring services have reported that the damage inflicted 
by oil and gas production on just the communities of animal 
vertebrate species in the northern regions of West Siberia 
amounted to 891 million rubles in 1992. 
  The technology for restoring the flora on damaged lands has 
been developed, so that they can be used for economic purposes 
again. The technology uses polymer materials immune to wind, 
water, and heat erosion. 
  In the fields of hydrobiology and ichthyology, a method has 
been proposed for the quantitative assessment of the ability of 
marine ecosystems to withstand anthropogenic influences. The 
degree of deviation in indicators of the state of the ecosystem 
from the statistical norm could serve as the basis for 
calculations of maximum allowable changes in each of the 
monitored characteristics and the overall indicator of ecosystem 
``well-being.'' 
  The most promising regions of the Lake Baykal basin from the 
standpoint of biological productivity have been selected, 
studies have been conducted to predict their ecological state 
under the influence of different types of anthropogenic 
activity, and territories requiring special protection have been 
delineated. 
  A system for the classification of animals has been 
developed 
as the first step in the creation of computerized zoological 
data banks. 
  In the earth sciences, a geological-ecological information 
system has been established for regions of intensive mineral 
extraction and pollution. The system will provide the necessary 
information for decisionmaking during the planning of economic 
activity and the forecasting of technogenic effects on the 
environment. 
  Proposals on the safe use of mineral resources in 
construction and the operation of systems for the subterranean 
disposal of sewage and production waste have been scientifically 
substantiated. A common set of regulations has been drawn up for 
the protection of subterranean regions and the environment 
during the exploitation of mineral deposits. 
  A plan for the safe underground disposal of radioactive 
waste 
has been drawn up with a view to the experience in exploiting 
uranium deposits and with consideration for the colossal amount 
of accumulated waste. The insulating properties of the 
geological environmental and the absorptive capacity of natural 
mineral mixtures used as technogenic geochemical barriers will 
play the main role in guaranteeing radiation safety. 
  An analysis of the ecological state of the seas of the 
Russian Federation was used as the basis for the published 
``Survey of the Ecological State of the Seas of the Russian 
Federation and Some Parts of the World Ocean.'' 
  The basic stages of shelf development in the main climatic 
zones of the earth have been the subject of systematic research. 
Processes of interaction by endogenous and exogenous factors in 
the creation of shelf patterns were summarized and analyzed, and 
this analysis was then used as the basis for ideas about the 
ecological safety of the Russian shelves. 
  The flow patterns and ``lifespan'' of organic polluting 
systems in the ecosystems of the Baltic and Bering seas and the 
southern part of the Chukchi Sea were studied, and the role of 
biological processes in the removal of toxic substances from 
certain parts of the Black Sea was defined. The mutation 
potential of the sediment of the Baltic and Black seas was 
studied for the first time. 
  A mathematical model simulating interaction by forest 
vegetation and the surface layer of the atmosphere was used to 
assess the role of forests in the global biochemical cycle. A 
proposed system of environmental impact studies will analyze 
more indicators than its foreign counterparts and will heighten 
the accuracy of predictions of the possible consequences of 
climatic changes and industrial pollution. 
  A multifrequency transmitter for simultaneous readings of 
the 
microphysical properties of aerosol and ozone up to altitudes of 
20-30 kilometers was launched from a high-altitude sounding 
station for the creation of automated greenhouse gas, ozone, and 
aerosol monitoring systems. It will secure the monitoring of the 
thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and its aerosol 
gas (or ozone) composition in the necessary range of altitudes. 
  Methods were developed to assess geo-ecological conditions, 
and the most common natural and socioeconomic factors 
contributing to crises were disclosed. 
  Regions of Russia were rated in terms of ecological stress, 
and maps of ``Estimates of the Reduced Stability of Regions of 
the Russian Federation'' were compiled (scale 1:800,000). 
  In the sphere of the comprehensive use and protection of 
water, a new plan was drawn up for the management of water use 
in the Russian Federation on the basis of the basin principle. 
  In the humanitarian and social sciences, different 
approaches 
were considered for the country's emergence from the ecological 
crisis at the same time as, and in connection with, the move to 
the market economy. An analysis of the ``command and control'' 
system of government administration and the use of economic 
regulators in the sphere of resource use and environmental 
protection in countries with a developed market economy was used 
as the basis for the planning of the main approaches to the 
establishment of an economic administrative system in our 
country in this sphere. 
  Measures for the institution of economic regulators of 
environmental protection--the system of taxation, the terms of 
credit, budget and extrabudgetary subsidies, ecological hazard 
insurance, and market mechanisms for the self-regulation of 
environmental projects, based on the privatization of property 
rights to different types of resources and the creation of a 
market for ecological services--were substantiated. 
  An analysis of the doctoral dissertations approved by the 
Higher Certification Commission in 1990-1992 provided 
interesting information about the state of scientific and 
technical projects in ecology and the lack of uniformity in 
their distribution among different fields of science. 
Dissertations on ecological subjects, for example, represent 
less than 3 percent (290) of the total number (10,000). More 
than 30 percent of the ecological projects (84) were defended in 
the biological sciences, fewer than 20 percent (50) were 
connected with technical sciences, approximately 13 percent (35) 
were in the medical field, 10 percent (31) were in agriculture 
and veterinary medicine, 5 percent were in chemistry (9) and in 
geography (8), and 1.5 percent (5) were in geology, the 
physico-mathematical sciences, philosophy, and the law. 
<H5>  7.2. Incorporation of Scientific Achievements </H5>
  During the move to the market, the problem of using 
scientific achievements in industrial or agricultural production 
has become a primarily economic problem, and a common technical 
policy can only be conducted by the state through 
supply-and-demand relations. The idea of the incorporation of 
scientific achievements according to plan has to be replaced by 
the idea of ecological marketing and government incentives for 
producers responsible for the ecologization of production. In 
connection with this, scientific and technical achievements in 
the sphere of low-waste technology and industrial waste 
treatment facilities must guarantee not only correspondence to 
ecological requirements, but also a high level of efficiency and 
affordability. In general, the demand for new equipment and 
technology will be shaped on the one hand by ecological 
standards and the conditions of production and product 
certification, and on the other by economic factors. 
  Projects have been conducted for industry, agriculture, and 
medicine on requisitions from enterprises and organizations and 
on an independent basis. Information about the projects has been 
disseminated through exhibits, ecological seminars for 
representatives of various industries, and special conferences, 
and less frequently through reports and news bulletins, the 
press, and television. 
  The results of several new, highly effective ecological 
development projects were made available to industry in 
1991-1992. More than 500 projects were displayed by 200 
enterprises at specialized exhibits. The displays included new 
materials and technological developments, environmental control 
and ecological forecasting systems, and methods of eliminating 
the pollutants of water, soil, and materials. Devices to reduce 
fuel consumption and reduce the toxicity of exhaust, new fire 
extinguishers, and new medicines and medical instruments were 
demonstrated. In addition, there were new means of pest and weed 
control, and the seeds of new strains of plants with heightened 
productivity and resistance to unfavorable influences. 
  The results of dozens of these projects are already being 
used. The drafting of procedural documents on environmental 
protection for various organizations and institutions took 
considerable effort. Scientific and technical documents were 
drawn up for the compilation of the ecological passports of 
enterprises for the purpose of on-site ecological monitoring and 
the planning of ecological measures. 
  Institutes and enterprises working on the development of new 
environmental technologies and equipment continued to maintain 
contacts with scientific institutions and industrial enterprises 
in the CIS countries, primarily Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Kazakhstan. To this end, joint conferences were held, and joint 
procedural recommendations were compiled. Interaction by the CIS 
countries in environmental protection should probably be based 
on the principles elaborated at the UN conference in Brazil, 
particularly the principles of environmental technology 
transfers. 
<H6>  Section 8. International Cooperation </H6>
<H5>  Cooperation in International Organizations </H5>
  In 1992 Russia took an active part in the organization and 
preparations for the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. Our state became party to 
the Convention on Biodiversity and the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change that were signed at the conference. Russia 
supported the policy-planning documents of the conference--the 
``Rio Declaration'' (a code of agreed principles of 
international cooperation by states in environmental 
protection), ``Agenda for the 21st Century'' (the strategy of 
global environmental cooperation for sustainable development), 
and the statement on the intelligent use, preservation, and 
development of forests. 
  Russia took part in forming the Commission on Sustainable 
Development (CSD), established by a decision of the UNCED, and 
is now a member of the commission. Efforts are also being made 
within the UN framework to delineate the spheres of authority of 
the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) and the CSD, UNDP [UN 
Development Program], and other organizations in the sphere of 
international environmental cooperation. 
  In the past year Russia helped to advance the all-Europe 
process in the ecological sphere by taking an active part in the 
preparations for the second all-Europe conference, ``Environment 
for Europe'' (Lucerne, 1993). During this process, priority was 
assigned to the drafting of a program of action for the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the compilation of a 
report on the state of the environment in the European region, 
and the reinforcement and development of regional mechanisms of 
cooperation. 
  Within the UNEP framework, Russia concentrated on the 
completion of projects within its own territory. The number of 
these projects was reduced considerably after our country failed 
to pay its membership dues in this organization in 1991-92. The 
remaining programs included ``Controlling the Human Health and 
Environmental Risks of Chemical Substances,'' ``Promoting the 
Use of Ecologically Safe Technology,'' ``Improved Methods of 
Environmental Data Storage and Management,'' and several others. 
  Russia's participation in the activities of the UN Economic 
Commission for Europe (ECE) in 1992 within the framework of the 
Senior Advisers to the ECE Governments on Environmental and 
Water Problems was distinguished by the attachment of greater 
significance to aid to countries with transition economies 
following the political changes in the region. This aid is 
extended through the mechanisms of the corresponding 
environmental conventions, through interaction with the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, through 
seminars on the ecological problems of states with a transition 
economy, and through the planning of projects in this field in 
conjunction with UNEP and other international organizations. 
  Russia's cooperation in the International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1992 mainly took the form of 
participation in drafting the East European program of the IUCN, 
which will be carried out in the form of specific projects. 
These projects are intended to improve the organization of 
environmental undertakings and their legal reinforcement, the 
development of natural preserves, the preservation of flora and 
fauna, the creation of data banks, and the monitoring of 
environmental components. To promote these projects with 
financial support from the IUCN, this organization opened a 
national bureau in Moscow. 
  Draft plans for the technical assistance of Russia were 
prepared and submitted to the Commission of the European 
Communities in 1992. Cooperation was organized with the 
information center of the Council of Europe, and the necessary 
documents were prepared for Russia's projected membership in 
this organization. 
  Interaction with the OECD is also being expanded, 
particularly in the handling of hazardous chemicals and the 
institution of proper laboratory practices in Russia. 
  Efforts to implement the strategy for the protection of the 
Arctic environmental, including the program of Arctic monitoring 
and environmental impact reports, are being reinforced. 
  The work on the plan for the ``Environmental Management and 
Protection of the Black Sea'' has begun within the framework of 
the Global Environmental Fund (GEF). 
  In March 1992 representatives of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, 
Belarus, and Ukraine signed the ``Wigry Declaration'' in Wigry 
(Poland), acknowledging the need for cooperation in the 
protection of forested territories in the border zones of these 
countries--territories of great ecological significance to these 
states and to the whole northeastern part of Europe. In 
accordance with the declaration, a working group was formed to 
draft the joint ``Europe's Green Lungs'' plan. The Russian 
territories covered by this plan are Kaliningrad, Novgorod, 
Pskov, and Tver oblasts in Russia. 
  There were joint undertakings with several World Bank 
missions. A request for a loan of 400 million U.S. dollars for 
ecological purposes was drafted (in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy). The organizational basis for the 
coordination of the work on World Bank projects in Russia is 
being established. Programs of technical aid to Russia in 
environmental protection through all other bilateral and 
multilateral channels will be managed within the confines of the 
appropriate coordinating mechanism. 
  In accordance with the Agreement on Interaction by the CIS 
States in the Ecological Sphere and Environmental Protection, 
signed on 8 February 1992, the Interstate Ecological Council was 
formed, two sessions of the council were held, and the 
Interstate Ecological Fund was created. 
<H5>  Bilateral Cooperation </H5>
  An intergovernmental agreement on cooperation with the FRG 
in 
environmental protection was signed in May. The work on the 14 
Russian- German projects in this field began in 1992. In 
September a Russian-German ecological bureau was opened in 
Berlin to assist in the preparation and implementation of joint 
Russian-German project plans and the establishment of direct 
ties between enterprises, organizations, and businessmen in the 
two countries in the sphere of environmental protection. 
  Efforts were made to develop cooperation with Northern 
countries. Bilateral intergovernmental agreements were signed 
with Finland and Norway in 1992, and agreements on cooperation 
with Denmark and Sweden were drafted. 
  Cooperation with Finland focused on the completion of the 
intergovernmental Russian-Finnish program signed in May 1992, 
the Program of Measures for the Reduction of Water Pollution and 
the Protection of the Baltic Sea Basin and Other Territories 
Adjacent to the Russian-Finnish Border. The program is aimed at 
the fulfillment of the international commitments the two 
countries assumed pursuant to the Declaration on the Protection 
of the Baltic Environment. To this end, a report is being 
prepared in conjunction with local environmental agencies on the 
state of bodies of water during the 1987-1993 period and on 
Russia's progress in carrying out the program as of 1 January 
1993. Considerable work was conducted on protected natural 
territories in the Republic of Karelia and in Leningrad and 
Murmansk oblasts. 
  The main areas of cooperation with Norway are connected with 
the problem of local environmental pollution by the 
Pechenganikel Combine and the pollution in the Barents and Kara 
seas. A group of experts was formed in April 1992 to investigate 
the possibility of radioactive pollution in these seas. The 
group made the arrangements for a joint expedition to the 
Barents and Kara seas, and one of the members of the expedition 
team was a representative from the IAEA. The results of the 
expedition served as the basis for a preliminary joint report, 
which was presented at an advisory meeting of the London 
Convention on Dumping. 
  In August 1992 the Russian-Norwegian group of experts 
investigated the handling of radioactive waste on ships of the 
nuclear fleet. The members of the group found that the work was 
well-organized and that it was being performed by qualified 
personnel, but they also expressed concern about the failure to 
solve the problem of the long-term storage (or burial) of 
radioactive waste. 
  In September 1992 the Russian minister of ecology and 
natural 
resources was invited to attend a meeting of the Council of 
Environmental Ministers of the Northern Countries for the first 
time in the history of Russia's relations with the Northern 
countries. After the meeting the ministers of Russia, Norway, 
and Finland toured the Pechenganikel Combine and the Kola 
Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, where they 
presided over the opening of a laboratory which had been 
equipped with contributions from Norway and Finland. They 
reached an agreement on more intense joint efforts in the 
Barents Sea region, including the stepped-up resolution of the 
problem of renovating the Pechenganikel Combine. A joint group 
of experts was formed at Russia's suggestion to draft 
alternative remodeling plans for the combine. 
  Russian-Danish cooperation included preparations for the 
conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement. The Danish 
Government allocated funds for environmental projects in Russia 
with the involvement of Danish firms, which had already done the 
preliminary work of reviewing possible plans for the renovation 
and construction of waste treatment plants in several Russian 
oblasts bordering on the Baltic Sea. 
  A meeting was held with representatives of the Swedish 
Ministry of Environment and Resources for the drafting of an 
intergovernmental agreement. 
  Interaction with the United States on the basis of an 
intergovernmental Soviet-American agreement continued; plans for 
1992 and some plans for subsequent years were approved at 
another meeting of the collective bilateral commission. In 
spring 1992 a second Russian-American expedition studied polar 
bears on Vrangel Island and on the coast of the Chukchi Sea. The 
monograph ``Studying the Ecosystems of the Bering and Chukchi 
Seas'' was published. 
  A plan of operations in five areas of cooperation for 
1993-94 
was approved at the second session of the collective 
Russian-Canadian commission on the environment. Priority was 
assigned to areas of cooperation connected with the protection 
of internal bodies of water from pollution, environmental 
policy, and man's interaction with the environment. The results 
of studies of pollution in the waters of Lake Onega and the Gulf 
of Finland were published and won a Canadian prize for 
excellence in 1992. 
  Russian-Dutch cooperation was developed successfully. A 
joint 
conference was held in 1992 to design the mechanisms of 
interaction by governmental and nongovernmental environmental 
organizations and institutions, and a seminar was held on 
environmental decisionmaking. In addition, a plan for the 
provision of Russia with mobile air quality monitoring 
laboratories began to be implemented. 
  The partners prepared and presented proposals on the 
development of cooperation with France. 
  Environmental protection was one of the topics of a 
Russian-Polish roundtable discussion. 
  Work performed in 1992 will serve as the basis for bilateral 
agreements with China and Mongolia and a Russian-Mongolian-PRC 
intergovernmental agreement on the establishment of a joint 
sanctuary. 
<H5>  International Conventions and Agreements </H5>
  Efforts to fulfill international commitments within the 
framework of multilateral environmental conventions and 
agreements and to draft new international legal documents in the 
environmental sphere continued in 1992. 
  The following were signed on behalf of the Russian 
Federation 
Government: the UN ECE Convention on the Trans-Border Effects of 
Industrial Accidents, the UN ECE Convention on the Protection 
and Use of Trans-Border Currents and International Lakes, the 
Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea from Pollution, 
the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on 
Biological Diversity, and the Convention on the Protection of 
the Marine Environment in the Baltic Zone of 1992. The 
Declaration on the Baltic Environment was adopted, and a Joint 
Comprehensive Program of Environmental Priority Projects in the 
Baltic Sea Basin was approved. 
  Intergovernmental agreements on the joint use and protection 
of trans- border bodies of water were signed in August 1992 with 
Kazakhstan and in November 1992 with Ukraine. Drafts of similar 
intergovernmental agreements with other CIS countries were 
prepared and submitted for negotiation. 
  The work of the Helsinki Commission continued. A special 
high-level group was formed at its 13th session to carry out the 
abovementioned program and held its first meeting. A special 
working group was organized to investigate the burial of 
chemical weapons in the Baltic Sea basin after World War II. 
  Parties to the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) met at a conference in March and 
approved a plan of action for the 1993-95 period. 
  The fulfillment of RF commitments stemming from 
participation 
in the Convention on Trans-Border Air Pollution Over Long 
Distances and the protocols to it continued. Emissions of sulfur 
in the Russian Federation were reduced by 41 percent of the base 
1980 level (instead of the 30 percent specified in commitments). 
  In 1992 the Russian Federation Government passed a decree 
``On the Activities of the `Vostok' Meteorological Synthesizing 
Center Within the Territory of the Russian Federation,'' 
securing the necessary conditions for the center's work in 
specific fields of research. 
  Work connected with the Convention on the Prevention of 
Maritime Pollution by Discharged Waste and Other Materials 
continued, and the results of the joint Russian-Norwegian 
expedition in the Barents and Kara seas were summarized. 
  In 1992 Russia fulfilled its commitment to reduce the 
quantity and use of ozone-destroying substances and to conduct 
scientific research and information exchange projects in 
accordance with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol. Other 
commitments were not fulfilled because of the socioeconomic 
difficulties in the country, and the failure to fulfill them was 
reported officially at the fourth conference of the signatories 
of the Montreal Protocol. 
<H6>  Section 9. Ecological Instruction, Training, and Educational 
Information Projects, and the Public Ecological Movement </H6>
<H5>  9.1. Educational Information Projects </H5>
  The news media are still the public's main source of 
ecological information. Around 50 different environmental 
periodicals are published in more than 30 of the country's 
regions. In the other regions, ecological information is 
published in special sections of the leading oblast, republic, 
city, and rayon newspapers. Economic difficulties have resulted 
in the reduced circulation or suspension of environmental 
periodicals in some regions. 
  The specialized central newspapers ZELENYY MIR and SPASENIYE 
and the journal YEVRAZIYA have continued their coverage of 
environmental issues. Because of economic difficulties, 
EKOLOGICHESKIY VESTNIK ROSSII has not been published since 
October 1992, and EKOLOGICHESKAYA GAZETA has gone out of 
business. 
  The newspaper VODA ROSSII, on the other hand, began to be 
published in 1992. It was founded by the Russian Committee on 
Water Resources and the Russian Scientific Research Institute of 
the Comprehensive Use and Protection of Water Resources. Water 
use and protection and water resource restoration projects are 
covered in the newspaper. 
  Ecological problems are discussed on the pages of central 
sociopolitical and literary publications. The percentage of 
environmental articles in IZVESTIYA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA is 
quite high. Ecological problems do not receive enough coverage 
in LITERATURNAYA GAZETA and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
  The newspapers have focused attention on the fact that the 
failure to observe existing laws and to implement earlier 
government decisions is the main reason for the country's 
ecological difficulties. They associate the improvement of the 
situation with financial assistance from foreign countries, 
international cooperation, and the scientific research and 
development projects of the public movement. 
  In 1992 the Atom, Kolos, and Ekologiya publishing houses 
published 16 books on environmental topics in editions ranging 
from 500 to 30,000 copies (in 1991 the Ekologiya Publishing 
House alone published 144 new books in a total of 50 million 
copies). 
  Besides this, the Gidrometeoizdat, Znaniye, and Nauka 
publishing houses, universities, and other institutions 
published the works of the institutes of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and its departments, the Russian Academy of Management, 
universities, and academic and scientific institutions in 1992. 
These were conference papers, scientific reports, surveys, 
compendiums, guides, and teaching aids on the most diverse 
aspects of ecology (95 different titles) in editions ranging 
from 100 to 73,000 copies. Three translations of books (from 
English) came out in editions ranging from 400 to 1,000 copies. 
  The state report ``On the State of the Environment in the 
Russian Federation in 1991'' and the Roskomgidromet almanacs on 
environmental pollution warrant special mention. 
  Ecological issues are the subject matter of television and 
radio programs in many of the country's regions. The extensive 
exchange of environmental television and radio programs is 
practiced by television and radio broadcasting companies in the 
republics of the Volga and Ural regions. 
  The protection of Lake Baykal is a constant topic of the 
broadcasts of television and radio companies in Buryatia, Chita, 
and Irkutsk. An environmental television marathon entitled 
``Baykal, Culture, and the Human Being'' in October 1992 was 
organized by the International Baykal Fund of the Buryat 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Buryat 
broadcasting committee in conjunction with state and public 
organizations in Chita, Irkutsk, and Mongolia. The donations 
were deposited in the Baykal Fund. 
  Chernobyl is the topic of television and radio programs of 
the Bryansk, Kaluga, Tula, and Smolensk broadcasting companies. 
The Bryansk company broadcasts a weekly radio program called 
``Our Tragedy--Chernobyl.'' Air time in Bryansk has been granted 
to specialists from the IAEA and to German and Japanese 
radiologists offering humanitarian assistance, and there are 
live hook-ups with the chairman of the State Committee on 
Recovery from Natural Disasters or his deputies. 
  Kaluga Oblast radio stations regularly report the radiation 
readings of the oblast sanitary and epidemiological station in 
oblast cities and rayons at the beginning of each month and 
comment on the reports of the statistical administration on the 
food supply and material and technical supplies in the rayons of 
the disaster zone. A 24-hour ``Union--Chernobyl'' marathon was 
televised in Tula. There is a series of ``Channel E'' programs 
on the ecological problems of the oblast in general and 
radiation levels in particular. 
  On a monthly radio program in Smolensk, ``Chernobyl--Lessons 
of the Tragedy,'' participants in cleanup operations, 
inhabitants of the affected regions, and ecologists comment on 
the situation in the oblast. 
  Although television and radio programs dealing with 
ecological issues inform the public and encourage public 
activity, experts believe that the coverage of ecological issues 
by the news media is clearly inadequate and frequently focuses 
only on current events. 
<H5>  9.2. Ecological Training and Instruction </H5>
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Environmental 
Protection'' instituted progressive changes in ecological 
education in Russia. Certain elements of the system of 
continuous ecological education (SNEO) envisaged by the law are 
already taking shape. 
  Several governmental and public structures were established 
in 1992 for the creation, development, and coordination of the 
SNEO. A department for the organizational and procedural 
reinforcement of ecological education and training was 
established as part of the Main Administration for Mass 
Information, Public Relations, and Ecological Education of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology. The Russian Federation 
Committee on Higher Education acquired a scientific-procedural 
council on higher environmental education and a 
scientific-procedural council on safe survival. 
  The Pedagogical Association of Russian Academic Institutions 
for General and Pedagogical Education acquired an 
academic-procedural council on pedagogical training in ecology. 
The Russian Council of Experts on Higher Education acquired a 
new section on ecology and the natural sciences. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology worked with the 
Russian Ministry of Education, the Higher Education Committee of 
the Russian Ministry of Science, and other concerned 
organizations and departments on the draft of a government 
strategy for the development of ecological training and 
education in the 1990s, a draft program of ecological training 
and education for 1993-94, and a plan for continuous ecological 
education. 
  Within the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' state 
scientific and technical program, many programs and procedural 
recommendations were drawn up for ecological training and 
education on all levels--from pre-school institutions to the 
advanced training network. The Russian Academy of Sciences 
prepared 20 curricula for schools and pedagogical VUZ's for 
ecology courses and environmental research and evaluation 
laboratories, as well as textbooks and teaching aids. 
  Nongovernmental organizations (the ``School of the Future'' 
fund, the International Youth Initiative for the Protection of 
Nature, the World, and Man, the Ecological Education 
Association, the International University, the Chemical 
Education Association, the Peace and Accord Federation, and 
others) have also been active in coordinating the informational 
and procedural aspects of ecological education. 
  Ecological education in Russia's schools can be developed 
through the ``ecologization'' of traditional subjects or through 
the introduction of a special curriculum. A combination of the 
two approaches is also possible. Priority has been assigned to a 
modular system of information for different levels of ecological 
education. 
  Educational institutions specializing in ecological 
instruction have made their appearance in Russia. These are 
ecological colleges (in Stavropol), academies (in Voronezh and 
Volgograd), institutes (in Stavropol, Barnaul, Yekaterinburg, 
Chelyabinsk, and Moscow), and vocational schools (in Moscow, 
Stavropol, Yekaterinburg, Belgorod, St. Petersburg, and 
Chelyabinsk), as well as ecology classes in general educational 
schools (in Kaluga, Tambov, Moscow, and Perm oblasts). 
  More than 550 institutions of supplementary education in 
Russia are teaching children the fundamentals of ecology and 
biology. The leading institution in the Russian system of 
extracurricular education is the Central Station of Young 
Naturalists (TsSYuN). 
  New educational institutions have been opened--such as the 
academies for young researchers and the ecological training and 
education centers. The Junior Forest Rangers and Blue Patrols 
have become more active. 
  The development of ecological education in higher academic 
institutions continued to take three basic directions: the 
inclusion of elements of ecological education in the whole set 
of academic subjects; professional training in environmental 
protection and resource conservation; the use of ecology classes 
to involve students in research projects and public 
environmental activity. 
  The new integrated subject known as ``Safe Survival'' 
continued to be introduced at all higher academic institutions. 
It is intended to arm students with the knowledge and practical 
skills needed for the development of safe and secure living and 
working conditions, the design of new equipment and 
technological processes meeting current environmental and safety 
requirements, and forecasting and informed decisionmaking in 
emergency situations for the protection of the population and 
industrial facilities from the possible effects of accidents, 
catastrophes, natural disasters, and the use of modern weapons. 
<H5>  [No 27, 1993 pp 4-7, 13] </H5>
  This training would culminate in a special ecological 
section 
of the diploma projects of the graduates of higher academic 
institutions, where the substantiation of the feasibility of a 
particular decision would necessarily include proof of its 
correspondence to ecological requirements. 
  The training of specialists for the ecological educational 
system in specialized departments of 10 VUZ's began in the 
1992/93 academic year. Priority has been assigned to ecological 
education in 100 pedagogical institutes and pedagogical 
universities. Advanced pedagogical training in ecology is 
generally conducted in classes dealing with specific issues. 
  In spite of all of the work that has been done for the 
creation of a continuous system of ecological education, most 
experts question the existence of this system in certain regions 
and believe that the inadequate work on ecological theories is 
the main obstacle. 
<H5>  9.3. Public Ecological Movement </H5>
  In 1992 more than 500 nongovernmental ecological 
organizations (NEO) in the Russian Federation were trying to 
solve environmental problems on the local, regional, 
interregional, and international levels. 
  The activities of the NEO's included the protection of 
animals, specific natural objects, and natural monuments, 
oversight of the observance of environmental laws, environmental 
impact studies, the training of ecological personnel, the 
publication of ecological information, educational projects, and 
other types of activity. The list of applied and 
scientific-technical projects conducted by NEO's is quite long. 
  Many NEO's have focused their attention on the possible 
consequences of the operations of specific enterprises (the 
Balakovo, Kostroma, Rostov, and South Ural AES's, the 
Kochetovskiy Water Engineering System, the Katunskaya and 
Cheboksarskaya GES's, the Balakhna TsBK [Pulp and Paper 
Combine], the Volkhov Aluminum Combine, the Pervomaysk Glass 
Plant (Smolensk Oblast), the Svetloyarskiy BVK Plant, the 
Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant, and the Khimprom Production 
Association in Cheboksary. A surprising number of NEO's are 
studying the problems of the Alazeya, Aldan, Amga, Angara, 
Bolshoy Irgiz, Vilyuy, Volga, Don, Yenisey, Zhizdra, Irtysh, 
Kazanka, Kolyma, Kubena, Lena, Mius, Ob, Protva, Severskiy 
Donets, Sukhona, Tobol, Ugra, Khoper, Chepets, and Yauza rivers 
and lakes Baykal, Payk-Yarve, and Rubskoye. 
  An analysis of the distribution of NEO's throughout the 
country indicates that they have been formed in all oblasts, 
krays, and republics. There are no nongovernmental ecological 
organizations in the autonomous okrugs. 
  The ``green movement'' in Russia is a new factor in the 
sociopolitical arena and has attracted the attention of 
specialists, the news media, and the population. 
  Nevertheless, in public opinion polls (which will be 
discussed later), 19.4 percent of the experts believed that this 
kind of movement does not exist in Russia, and 72.8 percent said 
that it is not a perceptible sociopolitical force in their 
regions (only 17.5 percent of the respondents expressed the 
opposite point of view, and 9.7 percent were unable to answer 
the question). On the other hand, 34 percent of the experts said 
they supported the ``green movement'' unconditionally, and 35.9 
percent said they agreed with some of its goals. 
  The crux of the problem apparently lies in the fact that the 
purely ecological mass movements (as opposed to political 
movements espousing popular causes) are still in the formative 
stage in our country and have just begun to take action. 
  The level of public concern can be judged from an analysis 
of 
letters to agencies of the executive branch of government. 
  In 1992 more than 16,000 citizens addressed personal or 
group 
complaints to the central staff of the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology. The messages with the highest number of signatures came 
from inhabitants of Krasnoyarsk Kray and Chelyabinsk Oblast who 
were disturbed by radiation readings in the regions of large 
mineral chemical combines, from residents of the Volga zone 
protesting the rising level of the Cheboksary reservoir and the 
flooding of agricultural lands, and from Altay residents 
demanding the completion of environmental impact studies prior 
to the construction of the Katunskaya GES. 
  Letters received in 1992 revealed the heightened activity of 
supporters of Greenpeace in the CIS states and distant foreign 
countries. Government agencies received more than 300 letters 
from activists of the Greenpeace movement in Russia and the CIS 
countries, demanding that the old nuclear reactors of the VVER 
type be shut down. Russian leaders received 600 letters from 
Greenpeace supporters in Australia, Great Britain, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and France protesting the clear-cutting of forests 
in the upper reaches of the Bikin River in Maritime Kray, the 
ancestral home of small ethnic groups and habitat of rare 
species of animals. Some letters from U.S. citizens referred to 
press reports of violations of hunting restrictions protecting 
Greenland seal pups. 
  Letters from people in Russia covered the whole geographic 
range from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka. One-fourth of all the mail 
came from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many letters were written 
by inhabitants of Altay Kray, Irkutsk Oblast, the Kuzbass, the 
Volga region, the Urals, and the Tatarstan Republic. By 
tradition, the population has been more likely to address 
central agencies than local ones. 
  The suggestions of citizens were taken into account during 
the appraisal of projects for the renovation of large industrial 
enterprises in Moscow Oblast (the Fosfaty Production 
Association) and the Novokuznetsk and Novolipetsk metallurgical 
combines and the drafting of programs for radical improvements 
in environmental conditions and public health in Bratsk, 
programs for the reduction of radiation in the Ural zone, 
Russia's anti-dioxin program, and the ``Russian Ecological 
Security'' program. 
  The numerous demands issued by environmentalists for the 
preservation of forests led to the Forestry Committee's decision 
to separate forest resource management from the industrial 
exploitation of forests. The proposals of citizens were taken 
into account during the preparation of the legislative bills 
``On Natural Territories Under Special Protection,'' ``On 
Resource Use Licenses,'' ``On Natural Resource Fees,'' and ``On 
the Revision of the Russian Federation Administrative and 
Criminal Codes To Institute Stricter Penalties for Violations of 
Environmental Laws.'' The plan for the comprehensive use and 
conservation of Russian water resources up to 2012 was drawn up 
with a view to the proposals of citizens. 
  Many correspondents have stressed that the main cause of all 
of the ecological problems in the country is the general lack of 
ecological awareness, including the ignorance of the heads of 
governmental, economic, and commercial structures. 
  The results of three sociological surveys were 
characteristic 
of the findings of numerous public opinion polls on questions of 
ecological safety in 1992. One was conducted in connection with 
the All-Russian Conference on Ecological Security Issues and the 
Implementation of the Law of the Russian Federation ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Moscow, 27-29 October 1992) by 
distributing questionnaires to 362 participants: the heads of 
state territorial environmental agencies, maritime boards of 
inspection of federal jurisdiction, and the scientific research 
organizations of the Ministry of Ecology. 
  In terms of composition, the group of respondents met the 
requirements of a panel of experts--individuals whose opinions 
represent the most objective view of the matter in question. 
  From the territorial standpoint, the respondents represented 
the Far East, Karelia, the Far North, the Moscow region, the 
Volga zone, the Northwestern region, Siberia, Tatarstan, the 
Urals, and the oblasts in the Chernozem zone. 
  Most of the experts (65 percent) gave the ecological 
situation in the country an extremely unsatisfactory rating, 50 
percent had the same opinion of their own regions, and 35 
percent gave the same rating to their own communities. 
  Furthermore, 34 percent said that the unsatisfactory 
ecological situation was partly to blame for the sociopolitical 
instability in Russia. In the opinion of 44 percent of the 
experts, this tendency is stronger on the regional level than on 
the national one. 
  An alarming symptom of problems in environmental protection 
activity was revealed when 73 percent of the experts said that 
existing regional environmental services are incapable of 
influencing ecological conditions effectively and blamed this on 
inadequate funding (52 percent of the experts), the absence of a 
developed legislative base (51 percent), the absence of a single 
and complete system for the management and oversight of 
environmental protection and resource conservation (51 percent), 
the shortage of technical equipment (21 percent), the 
insufficient coordination of the activities of environmental 
services and other government agencies (22 percent), the 
shortage of ecological specialists on the staffs of these 
services (14 percent), and the inadequate interest in ecological 
matters on the part of regional administrations and elected 
bodies (29 percent). 
  Around 55 percent of the experts said that the present 
structure of management in environmental protection and resource 
use requires radical changes, particularly in the separation of 
the functions of resource use and monitoring, the establishment 
of a single system for the management and coordination of 
monitoring services, and the improvement of the technical base 
of monitoring services. 
  The overwhelming majority of experts (82 percent) believed 
that natural resources should be federal property, namely: crude 
resources--65 percent, forests--54 percent, land--43 percent, 
all animals--38 percent, and fish resources--33 percent. 
  Around half of the polled experts supported the creation of 
a 
federal ecological inspection service, with 46 percent viewing 
it as a department of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, 7 percent 
saying that it should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry 
of Ecology, and 29 percent suggesting that it act as an 
autonomous agency of government control. 
  According to 85 percent of the experts, the creation of a 
single ecological monitoring system could do much to improve the 
ecological situation in the country. 
  A survey conducted in spring 1992 in Stavropol Kray, 
Karachay-Cherkessia, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Yakutia, Karelia, 
Dagestan, and Orenburg Oblast studied the opinions of the 
following specific groups with regard to ecological security 
issues: people's deputies, the personnel of executive committees 
and the news media, members of the intelligentsia, staff members 
of scientific research institutes and higher academic 
institutions, the administrators of state enterprises and 
institutions, the personnel of law enforcement agencies, the 
clergy, and the managers of cooperatives and joint ventures. 
There were 500 respondents in each of these groups. 
  When respondents were asked about the most promising ways of 
improving ecological conditions in populated regions, they 
assigned priority to the replacement of old production units 
with ecologically clean ones and the institution of stricter 
control by local government agencies and the public over the 
observance of environmental laws. The next in order of priority 
were the legislative stipulation of the obligations of 
enterprises and departments to compensate for environmental 
damage, an increase in centralized transfers of funds to local 
budgets for environmental measures, and the closure of all 
enterprises representing potential health hazards in the region. 
Less importance was attached to the institution of independent 
environmental impact studies in regions and the extensive 
coverage of regional ecological issues in the news media. 
  The opinions of the respondents in the ``select groups'' on 
these matters coincided almost completely with the opinions of 
the ``experts.'' 
  One of the disturbing findings of this study was the 
perceptible spread of the belief that regional solutions are 
preferable to national ecological measures. In Stavropol Kray, 
for example, 15 percent of the respondents in the survey of 
special groups suggested that the formation of independent 
republics in Russia would lead to better solutions to ecological 
problems, and this opinion was also expressed by 30 percent of 
the respondents in Karelia, 41 percent in Yakutia, 31 percent in 
Orenburg Oblast, 34 percent in Dagestan, 39 percent in Buryatia, 
41 percent in Karachay-Cherkessia, and 44 percent in 
Bashkortostan. 
  To some extent, these attitudes are a reflection of the 
political and economic confrontation between the center and the 
regions in the sphere of ecological awareness and could be used 
by regional political currents to their own advantage. It is 
quite probable that attempts at the centralized management of 
ecological security will be impeded by demands for the 
redistribution of prerogatives and resources in favor of the 
regions. 
  The influence of the regional structures under the 
jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry of Ecology in the 
development of ecological awareness in their regions was 
questionable and, in the opinion of 49.5 percent of the 
``experts,'' they are incapable of exerting any influence in 
this sphere. The reasons they listed included the unsatisfactory 
training of specialists, the inadequate use of the news media, 
the insufficient funding of projects, the dependence of regional 
agencies on local governments, and the deficient technical base. 
<H6>  Summary </H6>
<H5>  1. Conclusions </H5>
  An analysis of reports on the state of the environment in 
the 
Russian Federation and natural resources in 1992 and on the main 
factors influencing them leads to the following conclusions. 
  The continued pollution of the environment with gaseous, 
liquid, and solid industrial and household waste, which degrades 
the community and jeopardizes public health, was still the most 
acute ecological problem of primary social and economic 
significance in 1992. 
  The decline of industrial production, which exceeded 18 
percent in 1992, was not accompanied by the anticipated 
commensurate reduction in technogenic effects on the 
environment. Emissions of atmospheric pollutants from stationary 
sources were reduced by only 11 percent*, the water removed from 
natural springs was reduced by only 5.4 percent*, and releases 
of hazardous substances in sewage decreased by only 9.7 percent*. 
  Motor transport is playing an increasingly decisive role in 
air quality in big cities. Emissions of hazardous substances 
from motor vehicles increased in 1992. They exceeded industrial 
emissions in 158 cities and represented more than 80 percent of 
the emissions from all sources in 36 cities. 
  In 1992 the level of air pollution in cities and industrial 
centers was just as dangerously high and just as stable as it 
had been in 1991. According to available records, around a third 
of the national population was exposed at least once in the year 
to harmful substances in amounts representing 10 or more times 
the permissible concentration, and around 20 percent lived in 
regions with constantly high levels of air pollution by several 
harmful substances. 
  Because of the reduced annual discharge of large rivers in 
southern Russia (by 10 percent for the Volga and from 15 to 40 
percent for the Don, Kuban, Terek, and others), the substantial 
reduction of releases of harmful substances in sewage in 1992 
did not lead to any perceptible improvement of water quality in 
the majority of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. 
  The state of sweet subterranean water is already critical. 
The total area of sources of constant pollution in subterranean 
waters has reached hundreds of square kilometers and extends to 
70 drinking water intakes, including the water supply in Tula, 
Orel, Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, Tambov, Ufa, and other cities. 
  The quality of the public supply of drinking water did not 
improve in 1992. In general, around 50 percent of the Russian 
population had to use drinking water which did not meet several 
hygienic requirements. 
  The pollution of marine coastal waters remained at the 
earlier level, with the exception of the eastern part of the 
Azov Sea, the western regions of the North Caspian Sea, and the 
eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and Kursk Bay, where 
concentrations of pollutants were higher. Observations of 
regions of earlier burials and releases of radioactive waste in 
the Barents Sea did not reveal any dangerous radioactive 
pollution of the marine environment. 
  Studies conducted in 1992 to clarify the after-effects of 
the 
Chernobyl accident expanded the boundaries of the zone of 
radioactive soil pollution by cesium-137 at a rate exceeding 1 
curie per square kilometer to 8,800 square kilometers. 
  Radiation readings within the territory of the East Ural 
radioactive track did not change in 1992. 
  The average concentration of radionuclides in the water of 
Russian Federation rivers remained the same in 1992, but waste 
disposal requirements and standards were violated at two 
enterprises. 
  The biological pollution resulting from the accidental 
introduction of animals, plants, and microorganisms with 
constantly expanding habitats and increasing numbers into the 
environment is inflicting perceptible damage on natural 
ecosystems and the evolution of agricultural crops within the 
territory of the Russian Federation and poses a threat to human 
health. 
  The considerable deterioration of the socioeconomic 
conditions of the life of the overwhelming majority of people in 
Russia was naturally reflected in medical and demographic 
indicators, according to which 1992 was the least favorable of 
all the postwar years. The birth rate declined for the first 
time, and to a considerable extent (11 percent), the rate of 
mortality rose (5 percent), and the result was the reduction of 
natural population growth. 
  In addition, negative changes in the public diet, the 
reduced 
availability of preventive health care and medical treatment, 
the heightened social tension in the society, and other factors 
led to a situation in which public health continued to be 
affected adversely by negative environmental factors--air and 
water pollution, impurities in foods, noise, electromagnetic 
waves, radiation, and others. Furthermore, even at their 
previous level, their role was certain to grow stronger under 
the conditions of a declining standard of living, and this is 
attested to by data on the higher rates of oncological disease, 
blood and upper respiratory disorders, complications of 
pregnancy, and other afflictions in cities and industrial 
centers with a high level of pollution in comparison with the 
rate of illness in the same segments of the population in 
relatively clean cities. 
  The monitoring of environmental pollution with substances 
posing the greatest hazards to the human being and regional 
flora and fauna--dioxins, diphenylene oxide, 
polychlorphenylbenzene, organo-metallic and other compounds--was 
still inadequate both from the territorial standpoint and from 
the standpoint of thorough observations in individual cities. 
The monitoring of benzpyrene levels revealed a lower average 
annual concentration, with the exception of six cities where a 
slightly higher rate of pollution by this carcinogen was 
recorded. 
  The pollution of soil with pesticides decreased in the 
Russian Federation as a whole, mainly because of the 30-percent 
reduction in their use in 1992. 
  The dispersion zone of technogenic emissions around 
industrial complexes is expanding. In 1992 these zones covered 
an area of 18 million hectares, and the area of topsoil polluted 
by heavy metals and fluorine reached 3.6 million hectares. 
  One particularly disturbing symptom is the intensification 
of 
soil erosion, which was present to varying degrees on 56 percent 
of all agricultural land, and the area of eroded chernozems 
increased by around 300,000 hectares during the year. Soil 
conservation efforts were reduced, however, in 1992. The area of 
water-logged and marshy land and land suffering from 
salinization, desertification, and other forms of degradation is 
also increasing. 
  A growing tendency toward the reduction of the catch of fish 
in large rivers, lakes, and ponds has been due to the 
unfavorable state of the habitat of ichthyofauna and the 
overfishing of valuable species in recent years. The catch last 
year was 18 percent below the 1991 figure and 30 percent below 
the 1989 figure. 
  The unsound mintai fishing practices in the Bering Sea and 
the unregulated international fishing in the open sections of 
the Sea of Okhotsk have reduced mintai stocks considerably. 
Stocks of other species of fish in the seas of the Far East have 
tended to grow, and the supply of crabs and edible squid and the 
size of marine mammal colonies have remained the same. 
  Stocks of East Baltic cod and the populations of Black Sea 
rosefish and gray mullet are still in a depressed state. Stocks 
of Azov sea roach, sea perch, anchovies, and Azov-Don herring 
were low in 1992. 
  Stocks of Baltic sprat and herring and Black Sea anchovies 
and sprat increased, and the state of some types of sturgeon in 
the Azov Sea was satisfactory. The state of virtually all 
species of semi-anadromous fish in the Caspian Sea was rated 
excellent. 
  In 1992 clear-cutting in forests exceeded 90 percent of the 
total felling area and the area of new stands of valuable 
species. There was still a tendency toward the growth of the 
area of dying forests under the management of the Federal Forest 
Service. Fires have played a substantial role, as well as pests 
and diseases. Efforts to combat these were conducted on less 
than one-fifth of the territory affected by pests and diseases. 
In the last five years, 13 million wooded hectares have been 
lost. This is almost double the area of effective reforestation 
(6.9 million hectares). 
  According to specialists, the regional flora in some parts 
of 
the Russian Federation are in a critical state, but the absence 
of inventories of objects and resources (with the exception of 
forests) precludes an objective assessment in the country as a 
whole and in separate regions. The absence of an effective 
legislative base, policy, and system of governmental control in 
the sphere of plant use and protection is a serious obstacle in 
the intelligent use of the potential of flora and the 
preservation of biodiversity. 
  The state of fauna has continued to deteriorate. The 
population of European saiga and some species of mountain goats 
and sheep have dwindled to a dangerous extent, and the numbers 
of wood grouse, quail, and Hungarian partridge have decreased. 
  The illegal hunting of wild game has acquired dangerous and 
destructive characteristics. The collection of marine 
invertebrates, snake venom, and rare and endangered species of 
animals was conducted without any restrictions or limits in many 
locations in 1992. It is particularly surprising that, although 
illegal hunting was on the rise everywhere, monitoring agencies 
discovered 15,000 fewer cases of poaching than they did last 
year. 
  The decline of the extraction volumes of almost all types of 
minerals, especially petroleum (15 percent), continued in 1992. 
Flames consumed 10 billion cubic meters of gas, just as they did 
last year. Losses of crude resources during the extraction and 
concentration processes remained high, and the rate of complete 
resource use remained low. 
  The network of natural territories under special 
protection--preserves, national parks, sanctuaries, and 
others--continued to grow in 1992. Their establishment has been 
opposed by economic structures, and their territory is 
constantly being reduced by the illegal expansion of local 
government agencies authorizing the grazing of livestock, the 
felling of timber, the appropriation of parcels of land, and 
even the closure of the natural reserves. 
  The dramatic rise in the cost of vacation accommodations and 
travel has alleviated the strain on health resorts. This has 
reduced the amounts of mineral water and therapeutic mud removed 
for consumption and has reduced their pollution in Kislovodsk 
and Pyatigorsk. Nevertheless, the absence of fundamentals of 
legislation on health resorts is having an adverse effect on the 
efforts to stop the degradation of natural surroundings in 
unique therapeutic territories. 
  There were no promising improvements in 1992 in regions with 
critical ecological conditions (the north of the Kola peninsula, 
the Moscow region, the northern Caspian zone, the central Volga 
and Kama regions, the Ural industrial zone, the territory 
surrounding the Siberian oil fields, the Kuzbass, the Norilsk 
industrial region, the Republic of Kalmykia, and the Chernobyl 
zone of radiation pollution. 
  The emissions, sewage, and solid waste of the enterprises 
making up the Norilskiy Nikel concern are inflicting 
considerable damage on the vulnerable ecosystem in the north of 
the Kola peninsula and in Krasnoyarsk Kray. 
  The state of bodies of water in Karelia and Leningrad 
Oblast, 
as well as Arkhangelsk, Sakhalin, Irkutsk, and several other 
oblasts, depends largely on the sewage of pulp and paper 
production units. 
  Ecological and socioeconomic conditions are still critical 
in 
parts of Bryansk, Kaluga, Tula, and Orel oblasts, which were 
affected most by the radioactive pollution resulting from the 
disaster at the Chernobyl plant. There are still urgent problems 
in the organization of economic activity and the restoration of 
polluted territories here. 
  Problems in the establishment of ecological administrative 
structures to improve the quality of life for the population and 
to compensate for the mental and emotional stress caused by the 
Chernobyl disaster and by radioactive pollution in other oblasts 
require further analysis. 
  The main ecological problem of the central chernozem oblasts 
and of Krasnodar and Stavropol krays--the maintenance and 
restoration of the fertility of chernozem soils damaged by 
erosion--grows more acute each year. 
  In Tyumen Oblast, Russia's main oil- and gas-producing 
region, measures to protect the environment are not commensurate 
with the adverse technogenic influences that are destroying not 
only natural complexes, but also the traditional lifestyle of 
small ethnic groups. In 1992 these processes also continued to 
develop in other peripheral regions with an abundance of 
commercial minerals. 
  The deterioration of the hydrological conditions of surface 
and ground water, which have changed under the influence of the 
Gorkovskoye, Rybinskoye, and Uglichskoye reservoirs, is still 
the main problem in Yaroslavl Oblast. 
  The water supply in the Republic of Kalmykia is in a 
critical 
state, and so is the land, which has been degraded by 
salinization, flooding, and desertification. 
  The Ural region and the Kuzbass now have the most 
unfavorable 
ecological conditions in Russia because of the excessive 
concentration of metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building 
plants and enterprises of the coal industry and other extractive 
industries. Their protracted operations have resulted in 
permanently high levels of air, water, and soil pollution and 
have destroyed the landscape. 
  Ecological conditions in the Moscow region are still 
disturbing. 
  An analysis of the environmental impact of economic 
complexes 
in 1992 indicated that enterprises of the coal industry and 
petroleum refining industry paid the least attention to 
environmental protection and resource conservation measures. 
Insufficient measures were also taken by enterprises of the 
timber and wood chemical industry and of the machine-building 
and construction complexes. 
  The operations of elements of the defense complex are having 
a specific effect on the environment, polluting the soil with 
the residue of rocket fuel components, causing the accumulation 
of toxic components of the rocket fuels of old weapons systems 
and supplies of chemical weapons, generating leaks and spills of 
petroleum products, fuel, and lubricants on land and at sea, 
dumping radioactive waste into the Northern and Far Eastern 
seas, etc. The dangerous effects of radiochemical and chemical 
production units and enterprises producing explosive substances 
on the population and the environment are a major problem for 
the defense complex. The ecological mishaps caused by the 
activities of the armed forces and the defense complex are the 
result of the absence of special legislative statutes to 
regulate their activity in line with ecological safety 
requirements and of insufficient control. 
  As a result of the deterioration of technological equipment, 
machines, and mechanisms, of malfunctions, and of the violation 
of technological requirements and regulations by personnel, 
there were more accidents in 1992 at enterprises of the 
metallurgical complex and the agrochemical and building 
materials industries, in the facilities of the Rosneftegaz 
corporation and other oil enterprises, in pipelines, and on 
railroads. 
  An analysis of industrial accidents from the regional 
standpoint indicates that the highest number of emergency 
situations took place in Tyumen Oblast and Krasnodar and 
Krasnoyarsk krays. A significant rise in the number of these 
accidents was also recorded in 13 other oblasts of the Russian 
Federation. 
  An analysis of the reasons for the increasing number and 
severity of major accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters 
indicated that the main causes were the following: 
  -- the excessive wear of fixed productive assets in power 
engineering, transportation, and industry, including highly 
hazardous production units (the degree of asset depreciation is 
70-90 percent in the petrochemical industry and at enterprises 
of the fuel and energy complex); 
  -- the high concentration of highly hazardous production 
units in small areas; 
  -- the location of industrial facilities in flood and 
earthquake zones; 
  -- the inadequate equipment of units responsible for the 
technical maintenance of modern accident detection and 
prevention devices; 
  -- the absence of economic mechanisms to guarantee safety; 
  -- the absence of an integral set of laws and standards to 
protect the population and territories against industrial 
accidents, natural disasters, and other emergencies. 
  Legislation in the sphere of environmental protection and 
resource use was developed on the federal level and in the 
republics in 1992. 
  The comprehensive fundamental law of the RSFSR ``On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment'' went into force and the 
laws of the Russian Federation ``On Mineral Resources,'' ``On 
Security,'' ``On Land Fees,'' and ``On Amendments and Additions 
to the Law `On the Social Protection of Citizens Exposed to 
Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the Chernobyl AES''' 
were enacted in 1992. 
  Important legislative instruments were adopted by the 
president of the Russian Federation (edicts and directives) and 
by the Russian Federation Government (decrees) to strengthen 
environmental protection and to define ways of restoring and 
conserving natural resources. 
  The Federation Treaty delineating the spheres of authority 
and jurisdiction of federal government agencies and government 
agencies of the sovereign states belonging to the Russian 
Federation was signed in March 1992 and led to significant 
changes in the efforts to improve environmental legislation. 
  Several of the republics belonging to the Russian Federation 
used this treaty as a guide in drafting their own laws to 
protect the environment and regulate resource use. 
  The declarations issued by several of the republics 
belonging 
to the Russian Federation stipulate that these republics are the 
sole owners of the natural resources located within their 
territory, limiting the effects of the existing Constitution of 
the Russian Federation and of federal laws. 
  The vague wording of statutes, the duplication of powers and 
responsibilities, and the absence of well-defined procedures of 
action in the existing system of legislation constitute the 
prerequisites for conflicts that will complicate the resolution 
of problems in the legal regulation of resource use. 
  The absence of definite guidelines in the system for the 
state control of resource use and environmental protection in 
1992, just as in the previous year of 1991, was due to the 
incomplete process of the delineation of the powers of federal 
government agencies and the government agencies of federation 
members, and also to the fact that some of the departments (or 
committees) of the Russian Ministry of Ecology were engaged in 
production-related operations as well as environmental activity 
in 1992, and this was causing them to strive for autonomous 
status. 
  The statute on the Russian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources, approved by the Russian 
Federation Government on 18 December 1992, officially assigned 
it the functions of coordination and comprehensive management, 
as well as the pursuit of a common scientific and technical 
policy in this area. 
  In 1992 state environmental agencies on all levels conducted 
work of broad scales on numerous levels, focusing on the use of 
economic methods to regulate resource use and protect the 
environment: 
  -- preparatory work was conducted on the federal level to 
improve records and assessments of resource potential and create 
a network of state surveys of real estate and natural resources; 
  -- the work on 150 regional and special programs in the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource use, financed 
mainly with local budget funds and the ecological funds and 
resources of enterprises, was in various stages of preparation 
and actual implementation; 
  -- fees for the use of natural resources were instituted in 
some parts of the Russian Federation, and the comprehensive 
licensing of resource use was instituted in many regions; 
  -- a standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance in 
the Russian Federation was drafted and approved. 
  Pollution fees were paid by 46,000 resource users, with 2.6 
billion rubles invested in environmental projects and 4.4 
billion deposited in ecological funds. 
  The introduction of economic methods of regulating resource 
use and environmental protection, however, was not enough, 
especially under the critical conditions of 1992 (marked by the 
destabilization of the financial system, the insolvency of 
enterprises, the growth of inflation, and so forth), to provide 
resource users with the necessary incentives to intensify 
environmental protection efforts. 
  Total capital investments in this field from all sources in 
Russia decreased by almost 20 percent in 1992. There was a 
particularly sizable decrease in investments in the protection 
and reproduction of flora and fauna, which represented only 7 
percent of the expenditures on these purposes in 1991. 
  During inspections to verify the observance of environmental 
legislation at 286,000 enterprises and organizations in Russia, 
state ecological control agencies suspended the operations of 
more than 700 shops, assemblies, and installations. 
  Administrative measures were taken against around 38,000 
violators, and criminal proceedings were instituted against 25 
individuals. 
  In 1992 ecological laws were enforced not only by specially 
authorized agencies in the sphere of environmental protection, 
but also by law enforcement agencies, particularly the 66 
environmental procuracies. 
  In 1992 agencies of the Russian Federation Procuracy 
conducted more than 5,600 investigations of environmental cases, 
resulting in the rescission of 1,915 illegal legislative 
instruments and proceedings against 6,300 officials. Internal 
affairs agencies investigating incidents of illegal fishing, 
seal trapping, hunting, and timber felling referred 880 criminal 
cases to the courts. 
  In 1992 all of the state ecological appraisers of the 
Russian 
Ministry of Ecology processed 56,000 designs, programs, and 
other documents. Around 30 percent were rejected or returned for 
revisions (33 percent in 1991). 
  In that year the Russian Federation had eight departmental 
monitoring services to monitor the state of individual elements 
of the environment and natural resources, each functioning 
according to a separate program, virtually uncoordinated with 
other programs. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology drafted a plan 
for 
the ecologically safe development of Russia and began forming 
the functional ecological safety subsystems of the RSChS. 
  Scientific projects to solve problems in environmental 
protection and resource conservation in 1992 were conducted in 
line with ``Russia's Ecology'' and 13 other state scientific and 
technical programs with combined funding exceeding 3 billion 
rubles. 
  The ``Criteria for the Evaluation of the Ecological State of 
Territories for the Purpose of Identifying Ecological Emergency 
Zones and Ecological Disaster Zones'' were drafted and are being 
tested. 
  The volume of new, ecologically acceptable technology 
incorporated in industry decreased, however, in connection with 
the economic crisis in 1992. 
  In 1992 Russia participated in the UN World Conference on 
Environment and Development, supporting all of its policy 
documents, and in the second European conference on 
``Environment for Europe.'' Cooperation in international 
organizations and on a bilateral basis also continued. Several 
plans, agreements, and treaties were signed on behalf of the 
Russian Federation Government. 
  The news media are still the public's main source of 
ecological information. Around 50 different environmental 
periodicals were published in more than 30 regions in the 
country in 1992. Economic difficulties precluded the publication 
of environmental periodicals in some regions. 
  Environmental programs on television and radio helped to 
shape public opinion and to encourage public environmental 
activity, but the coverage of ecological issues by the media was 
clearly inadequate and frequently focused only on current events. 
  Many programs and procedural recommendations for ecological 
education and training on all levels--from preschool 
institutions to advanced training networks--were drafted within 
the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' state scientific and 
technical program. 
  The first academic institutions specializing in ecological 
education-- ecological colleges, academies, institutes, and 
specialized schools--made their appearance in Russia in 1992. 
  Specialized departments in 10 of the country's VUZ's began 
training specialists for ecological educational systems in the 
1992/93 academic year. 
  All of this indicates that the work performed in 1992 by the 
Russian network of state ecological agencies and services in the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource conservation was 
extensive and multifaceted, and that it was distinguished by the 
increasingly broad use of economic methods of management in this 
sphere, but the unfavorable socioeconomic conditions of the 
period precluded quick and dramatic results. 
<H5>  2. Forecasts and Recommendations </H5>
  The analysis of tendencies toward change in the state of the 
environment and natural resources in 1992 reveals that the 
ecological forecast in the state report ``On the State of the 
Environment in the Russian Federation in 1991'' was accurate in 
general and in the main particular areas. 
  Estimates based on the information in that report confirmed 
the fact that the future ecological impact of production at a 
time of protracted economic crisis would be intensified under 
the influence of the following factors: 
  -- the high levels of constant emissions of the gaseous, 
liquid, and solid waste of production and the increasing 
frequency of accidents caused by the impermissible deterioration 
of technological equipment, vehicles, and waste treatment plants; 
  -- violations of technological requirements as a result of 
shortages of spare parts and materials and the need for the more 
extensive use of substandard raw materials and fuel; 
  -- the reduced investments in the renovation of fixed 
productive assets and in the incorporation of new progressive 
technology and equipment in basic production units and 
environmental installations; 
  -- the reduced expenditures on the operation and maintenance 
of waste treatment equipment, and so forth. 
  Losses of forests due to fires, pests, and diseases will 
probably increase in connection with the acute shortage of funds 
for airborne forest fire prevention services and for the means 
of combating forest pests and diseases. 
  Losses of land resulting from soil erosion are expected to 
increase because erosion will be intensified during the initial 
period of the establishment of private farms in agriculture by 
the shortage of the necessary farming equipment and the 
anticipated influx of people without the necessary knowledge and 
experience. 
  The rights delegated to local government agencies during the 
period when the economic crisis was developing are likely to be 
used more and more extensively for economic expansion by these 
agencies into natural preserves and other protected territories 
for the purpose of hay mowing, livestock pasturing, hunting, 
timber felling, and so forth. 
  The increase in illegal hunting and fishing, the 
unrestricted 
harvesting of commercial medicinal plants, mushrooms, and 
berries, and the trapping of rare and endangered species of 
animals are expected to continue. In the next few years the 
problem of preserving biodiversity will acquire particular 
urgency on the regional and federal levels and will arouse the 
increasing concern of international organizations. 
  The absence of promising signs of improvement in the public 
standard of living, health care, and the resolution of 
socioeconomic problems at a time of permanently high levels of 
pollution precludes forecasts of improvement in the state of 
public health and in medical and demographic indicators. 
  There is no doubt that sociopolitical stability, a strong 
economy, better laws, the strict enforcement of these laws, and 
flexible, precise, and farsighted government control are 
necessary and essential prerequisites for radical improvement in 
ecological conditions in the Russian Federation. It is also 
clear, however, that stable economic development cannot be 
achieved in a country where nature has been mistreated, 
resources have been depleted, and public health has been 
undermined. This is precisely why the efforts to secure the 
protection of natural resources and improve the quality of the 
environment cannot be underrated now, at this time of 
instability and of protracted severe crisis. 
  Enhancing the effectiveness of the activities of 
environmental and law enforcement agencies on all levels to 
secure legality in the sphere of resource use will require the 
continued improvement of environmental laws and the standards 
and procedures pertaining to environmental protection and the 
conservation of natural resources under the conditions of the 
market economy. In particular, it will be necessary to pass new 
water quality laws, laws to protect flora and fauna, clean air 
laws, laws on the decontamination of particularly hazardous 
waste and the recycling of waste products, and others. 
  Reducing the number and severe after-effects of major 
accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters will require the 
passage of the necessary set of legislative instruments. The 
following would also be advisable means of attaining the same 
goals: 
  -- the reorganization of the existing system for the 
forecasting and departmental monitoring of dangerous natural 
phenomena and the creation of additional systems to secure 
seismic safety; 
  -- the unification of all departmental monitoring systems 
within a single Russian Federation state ecological monitoring 
system set up by the Russian Federation Minprirody and within 
the automated data management system of the Russian GKChS; 
  -- the provision of safety inspection units with modern 
technical diagnostic equipment; 
  -- the reorganization of emergency rescue services and their 
provision with modern equipment to localize and eliminate the 
after-effects of accidents and disasters. 
  The heightened effectiveness of the use of economic methods 
of regulating resource use and environmental protection will 
require the following: 
  -- the calculation and institution of standard fees for 
electromagnetic, radioactive, and noise pollution; 
  -- the quicker approval of documents pertaining to economic 
incentives for environmental protection, including the 
introduction of the necessary changes into existing tax laws; 
  -- the development of a group of measures for the use of 
state tax, credit, and price policies to provide economic 
incentives for the intelligent use of resources, the 
conservation of resources and energy, and the incorporation of 
nonpolluting equipment and technology; 
  -- the acceleration of efforts to improve and incorporate 
economic mechanisms to regulate water use; 
  -- the development of a group of standard fees for the use 
of 
animal resources; 
  -- the Russian Federation Government's quicker passage of a 
decree ratifying the statute on the procedure for licensing 
resource use and the unified Russian Federation system of 
surveys of real estate and natural resources. 
  The following would also be advisable in the near future: 
  -- the drafting and enactment of a statute on the licensing 
of activity connected with high-risk industrial production; 
  -- the drafting and implementation of a special 
comprehensive 
program to prevent the pollution of the environment with dioxins 
and other particularly hazardous compounds; 
  -- the organization of noise pollution monitoring; 
  -- the institution of stricter control over the production, 
distribution, and disposal of particularly hazardous chemical 
compounds, especially halogen organic compounds; 
  -- the drafting and implementation of a state program for 
the 
maintenance and restoration of the biological diversity of flora 
and fauna; 
  -- the coordination of the efforts of federal agencies of 
the 
executive branch of government and the government agencies of 
federation members for the stronger protection and restoration 
of biological resources under their joint jurisdiction; 
  -- the institution of stricter control over the introduction 
of animals, plants, and microorganisms into the territory of the 
Russian Federation and the planning and approval of effective 
measures to localize previously introduced harmful species; 
  -- the coordination of the legal standards and structure of 
state control of the animal kingdom with the requirements of the 
developing market economy and the institution of more complete 
records of the most common species of animals; 
  -- the drafting of additional sections of environmental 
legislation on liability for violations of the rules of natural 
preserves and the institution of state statistical reports on 
natural preserves; 
  -- the Russian Federation Government's quicker drafting and 
passage of a decree on measures to regulate and stimulate 
entrepreneurship in the production of environmental goods and 
services. 
  The following will also be necessary: 
  -- the complete funding of the ``Russian Ecological 
Security'' program; 
  -- the drafting of special federal programs on waste, soil 
erosion, reforestation and forest protection, and others. 
  It would also be useful to draft a long-range program for 
the 
gradual move to international standards for the technological 
processes, equipment, and products with the most adverse effects 
on the environment. 
  An information service should be established within the 
system of the Russian Minprirody for the collection and storage 
of information about the state of the environment and natural 
resources and data on the ecological features of domestic and 
foreign technological processes and equipment affecting the 
environment. 
<H6>  Addendum </H6>

  This state report is a collective work by specialists from 
43 
ministries and departments of the Russian Federation, the 
scientists of sectorial research institutes, and the scientists 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences with expertise in the monitoring and 
analysis of the state of the environment and natural resources, 
the regulation of resource use, the exercise of state ecological 
control over the activities of resource users, and the 
supervision of environmental protection measures. 
  The purpose of the report is the provision of state 
governing 
bodies and the population of Russia with objective, 
systematized, analytical information about environmental 
quality, the state of natural resources, and tendencies toward 
change under the influence of economic activity. The report 
contains information about the legal, organizational, technical, 
and economic measures that are being taken within the territory 
of Russia to protect the environment and conserve and restore 
natural resources and will serve as a basis for the choice of 
priority fields and areas of environmental activity and programs 
to aid in the improvement of ecological conditions in Russia. 
  When the Russian Minprirody was preparing this report, it 
was 
striving to present the most complete and objective description 
of environmental conditions in the Russian Federation in 1992 in 
the interest of ecological safety and stable economic 
development. 
  The specialists who prepared the report, however, are fully 
aware that the information presented in this document is not 
commensurate with the scales and significance of the 
``ecological problem'' and cannot satisfy specialists and the 
public completely. There are several objective and subjective 
reasons for this. We hope that our work on the 1992 state report 
will help us recognize them and surmount them in the future. 
  Nevertheless, the submitted document is an attempt to 
present 
information about the state of the environment in Russia in 1992 
in fairly general and accessible terms and to underscore the 
importance of ecological issues and solutions in Russia today.
