FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Abyss looms' as tin hits fresh
20-year low
THE NIGHTMARE for tin producers worsened yesterday as prices on the London
Metal Exchange fell to fresh 20-year lows. The move followed a decisive
break through Dollars 5,000 a tonne - below most mines' production costs -
for three-month metal on Wednesday. Overnight the price fell to a low of
MDollars 12.50 a kilogram in Kuala Lumpur, where traders blamed selling from
China and Brazil, high stock levels and no consumer interest.
Three-month tin closed last night at Dollars 4,955 a tonne, down Dollars 20
on the day and Dollars 92.50 on the week. At the beginning of the year the
price was above Dollars 6,000 a tonne.
Analysts painted a bleak picture for tin yesterday. 'The abyss looms,' said
one, while another described the market as 'on its knees'.
Stocks in LME warehouses stand at 20,415 tonnes, about 100 tonnes below
recent highs. But worldwide stocks are estimated at a total of 40,000
tonnes, the highest level since 1986, not long after the International Tin
Council's collapse left 100,000 tonnes of stock overhanging the market.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst with Commodities Research Unit, estimates
consumption this year at about 180,000 tonnes, which puts the stocks at
around 12 weeks of supply. 'Demand is very weak and supplies are strong,' he
said yesterday. In addition to Brazil and China, Vietnam has emerged as a
seller, while scrap is coming out of Russia.
At these levels some weak producers could be forced to call it a day, he
suggested, then the market might be able to form a base.
London Metal Exchange turnover rose by 46 per cent last year following a 27
per cent rise in 1991. Mr Raj Bagri, chairman, in the LME financial
statement for 1992, described the rise - for the sixth successive year - as
'heartening' since the base metals industry had suffered more than most in
what had proved to be a difficult trading year. However, exchange income
fell back to Pounds 4.36m from Pounds 4.54m in 1991, while pre-tax profits
retreated to Pounds 1.05m from Pounds 1.41m.
