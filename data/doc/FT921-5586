FT  03 MAR 92 / The appliance of commerce: Wellcome's increasing presence in
the international pharmaceuticals market
What would Sir Henry Wellcome think? The company he founded in 1880 to make
'compressed medicines' or tablets, has become one of the world's
fastest-growing pharmaceuticals businesses.
Now, with the proposed sale by the medical charity, Wellcome Trust, of much
of its controlling stake, the company will fully enter the commercial world.
It will have to satisfy the more rigorous demands of institutional
shareholders but will have greater management freedom to run its business.
Since 25 per cent of Wellcome's shares were floated on the stock market in
1986 it has become one of the largest public companies in the UK. The Trust,
to which Sir Henry bequeathed the company, has seen the value of its
shareholding grow to a point where it feels it must reduce its 73.6 per cent
shareholding to diversify its investments.
At the time of the flotation Sir Alfred Shepperd, the chairman and chief
executive who retired in 1990, insisted that the group was a commercial
business, run to make profits. Since then the company has become a much
stronger competitor in the world drugs industry.
As one industry observer put it: 'The company had a pretty closeted past.'
Research scientists could enjoy working at Wellcome as though it were an
academic institution. The company would pursue the scientifically
fascinating rather than the commercially promising.
But that has all changed. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, has
been pursuing a restructuring programme aimed at sharpening the business and
increasing profit margins. The strategy is nearing completion and he now
supports the Trust's plans to sell a large part of its stake. Previously he
had feared such a large sale would have been disruptive.
As part of this programme, several tough decisions have been taken. The
group gave up work on TPA, a blood clot dissolving drug. That was hard, Mr
Robb says, after more than Pounds 40m had been spent on it. But Wellcome
realised it would be difficult to make a commercial success of the product.
Other measures have included the sale of peripheral activities where margins
were low. These included businesses, such as vaccines, to which Wellcome had
a strong sentimental attachment. There have been cuts in overheads,
including about 10 per cent of the 400 jobs at its London head office.
Wellcome has also made a much more determined effort to market its drugs.
As a result the company's fast profit growth, which had slowed in the
1989-90 financial year, has resumed. This year pre-tax profits are forecast
to top Pounds 500m, a rise from Pounds 402.9m in 1990-91. And the balance
sheet is strong, with net cash of about Pounds 200m at the end of August
last year.
The story of Wellcome's stock market career has been dominated by Retrovir,
its high-profile Aids drug. Launched in 1987, it is still the only widely
used treatment for the condition. The company's share price has fallen and,
more often, risen with the ebb and flow of news about Retrovir.
But there is more to the company's drugs profile. It has arguably the best
record of any UK drug company for turning research and development into new
products. It has accelerated the rate at which it launches new drugs,
developing a product almost every year for the past decade.
Wellcome's strength in research and its dominance of the anti-viral market
have been the basis of its growth. But the therapeutic power of its products
had not been matched by its salesmanship.
Its best-selling drug, Zovirax, used to treat herpes, shingles and now
chicken pox, was launched in 1981. Only now, as its patents are approaching
the end of their lives, is it realising its full sales potential of about
Pounds 500m a year. Since Mr Robb joined the company in March 1989 as deputy
chief executive, co-marketing deals and higher prices for Zovirax have
improved profit margins.
Both Retrovir and Zovirax faced the problem of being launched into a new
market, although the publicity surrounding Aids has meant a greater public
awareness of Retrovir. Its sales growth since its launch has outstripped
that of Zovirax in the initial years. 'Retrovir, too, was not as well
marketed as it might have been,' says Mr Jonathan de Pass, an industry
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The possibility that Wellcome is failing to maximise drugs sales and,
therefore, profits is also reflected in the company's 25 per cent gross
profit margin - lower than that of its competitors in the drugs business,
ICI, Glaxo or Fisons.
Wellcome's newfound marketing priority is important, too, in its
non-prescription drugs business. It is noted for its cough and cold
remedies, Actifed and Sudafed, and for other over-the-counter (OTC) products
that can be bought without a prescription, such as Calpol, a pain reliever
for infants. Aggressive marketing is also preparing the ground for the sale
of Zovirax as a treatment for cold sores, without a prescription.
Mr Robb denies that the business of selling low-technology OTC cures is out
of place in a research-driven company. He says: 'A significant position in
OTC will become increasingly important as pressure on prices of prescription
drugs increases.' As margins are squeezed on prescription drugs Wellcome can
turn to OTC drugs as a stable source of income.
While Glaxo, for example, disposed of its OTC drugs several years ago, Mr
Robb sees OTC as a means of extending the profit-earning life of a drug.
When a prescription drug loses its patent, rivals can produce the same drug
cheaply. But the hope is by turning a prescription drug into a branded
consumer product premium prices can be maintained. Already Zovirax is being
sold over the counter in New Zealand. SmithKline Beecham has a similar
philosophy. It has earmarked its ulcer treatment, Tagamet, once the world's
best-selling drug, for OTC sales to treat upset stomachs. Wellcome is
seeking a partner to expand its international OTC business. It hopes to
announce a deal this year.
Wellcome's need for marketing partners is not confined to OTC drugs. While
it is strong in selling anti-viral drugs, its new products - essential for
the group's profits growth - are in areas where it has little experience.
These include epilepsy, muscle relaxants (for operations), hepatitis-B and,
eventually, the potentially big market of migraine treatments. These new
drugs will need to compensate for the eventual decline of Zovirax.
Investors considering whether to buy the shares released by the Trust will
have to decide whether the promise of products in the pipeline will enable
Wellcome to continue its strong stock market performance.
