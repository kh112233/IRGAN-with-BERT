FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: New code for prison staff
A NEW disciplinary code of practice to cover all grades of Britain's 24,000
prison staff came into effect yesterday, Home Secretary Michael Howard said
in a Commons written reply.
It introduces a new system of progressive disciplinary warnings and
penalties.
Mr Howard said: 'Responsibility for taking disciplinary action up to and
including dismissal is being devolved to prison governors and to heads of
division at Prison Service Headquarters.'
