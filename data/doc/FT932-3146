FT  16 JUN 93 / Bundesbank praise for France on interest rates
THE BUNDESBANK president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, yesterday congratulated
France on getting its interest rates lower than those in Germany thanks to
its better inflation record.
He told the French Senate in Paris that France had relative 'economic and
monetary stability, while, alas, in Germany we cannot boast about the same
stability in prices', an indication that the Bundesbank remains concerned
about the German inflation rate which is a couple of points above France's.
But he said the Bundesbank had at least 'kept the D-Mark stable for 40 years
and intends to go on doing so'.
However, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, another influential member of the
policy-making Bundesbank council, said a slowdown in the pace of German
money supply expansion could give the central bank room to lower interest
rates.
In an interview with AP-DJ Mr Gaddum, the directorate member responsible for
credit market operations, said he could not offer any indication about the
money supply figures for May. But 'money supply developments (in May) could
indeed move back within the corridor in line with the economic cooling-off',
he said. 'We will wait and see if the money figures provide us with room to
manoeuvre.'
He declined to comment on the present extent of manoeuverability nor the
pace at which rate cuts should be undertaken.
In Paris, Mr Schlesinger firmly quelled any speculation that the German and
French central banks might establish some specially close bilateral link,
following independence for the Bank of France which has been approved by the
National Assembly and now awaits action by the Senate.
He said the long-time close co-operation between the French and German
central banks had taken on a 'particular dimension' during the past year's
franc crises, but this needed no further 'reinforcement' beyond the links
that bound all European Community central banks.
