FT  13 APR 94 / Extra powers for Guatemala army: Wave of unrest and violence
against foreigners
Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon announced late on Monday the country's
powerful military would take charge of internal security in an effort to
combat violence and growing unrest, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
'The army. . . will act with all its energy but within legal limits against
groups who have been committing acts of violence and creating a climate of
instability,' said Mr de Leon in a televised speech.
Mr de Leon called the national police force 'incapable' of ensuring order
but added the army's participation in his new security plan would not lead
to the militarisation of Guatemala. 'The government will maintain its
legalistic policies.'
Guatemala has been in a state of crisis for the past month with a series of
attacks on foreigners, assassinations and kidnappings, and Mr de Leon has
been under pressure to deliver tough solutions to combat unrest.
The president of the country's highest legal body, Mr Epaminondas Gonzalez,
61, was assassinated by gunmen outside his Guatemala City home 10 days ago.
Hysteria that foreigners might be stealing local children and selling their
organs for transplants has provoked three attacks on American tourists in
the past month.
An American journalist, Ms June Weinstock, from Fairbanks, Alaska is still
in a coma after an assault by peasants who beat her when she tried to
photograph a child in northern Guatemala.
Mr de Leon, once Guatemala's top human rights official and an outspoken
critic of the country's armed forces, was elected president in June last
year to replace former president Jorge Serrano, who was ousted after a
failed bid for dictatorial powers.
