FT  20 NOV 92 / Taiwan SE open to foreigners
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, in an effort to stimulate its ailing stock
market, is to permit foreign brokerages to invest in Taipei. But brokers
said it was little more than a welcome signal that the government does not
want to see share prices go any lower.
Under the new guidelines, foreign brokerages with equity assets of at least
Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m) will be encouraged to invest an initial Dollars
50m in the market.
