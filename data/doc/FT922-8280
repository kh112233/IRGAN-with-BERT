FT  14 MAY 92 / Gatt ruling fuels US/EC tension
A GATT disputes panel has ruled against the US after a complaint by the
European Community over Washington's 'Buy American' policy.
The panel said the proposal to buy a sonar mapping system broke rules on
government procurement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
that
the US should open bidding for the system to overseas suppliers.
However, the US, which disputes the panel's interpretation of Gatt rules,
yesterday opposed adoption of the report by the world trade body's
government procurement committee. Reports have to be adopted by consensus
under Gatt procedures. The report will come back to the committee at its
meeting in June.
The dispute relates to the purchase of a Dollars 2.4m sonar mapping system -
an underwater radar system, which uses ultrasound to detect objects. The
purchase was part of a 1989 contract for Antarctic research support services
between the National Science Foundation, a US government agency, and
Antarctic Support Associates, a private company. The US Congress imposed a
'buy American' requirement. The administration argued the purchase was not
covered by the Gatt code, which does not apply to service contracts.
The panel ruled that the purchase constituted government procurement even
though it would be done through a private company, because the US government
was putting up the money and would own the sonar mapping system.
Tension between the EC and the US has mounted since February, when Mrs Carla
Hills, US trade representative, set a January 1 deadline for the imposition
of sanctions unless the EC altered its public procurement legislation.
On Tuesday, the EC urged the US to end discrimination against non-US
companies tendering for public contracts and to call off threatened
sanctions.
