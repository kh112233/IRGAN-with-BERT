FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tortoise catches up with the
hares - NAB has emerged as Australia's strongest bank
IT WAS all in the body language. In Melbourne, Mr Don Argus, managing
director of National Australia Bank (NAB), was relaxed and chatty as he
outlined the reasons for his bank's growing success.
A few hundred kilometres away in Sydney, Mr Frank Conroy, chief executive of
Westpac Banking Corporation, was determined but tense as he toughed out
questions on Westpac's failures.
The two men had just announced sharply contrasting results for the year to
end-September, confirming the dramatic upheaval in Australian banking as a
result of the fall-out from economic recession and the loose lending
practices of the 1980s.
As Mr Conroy was forced to admit, Westpac is the big loser. Only a few years
ago it was the country's biggest and most profitable bank. Boasting the
slogan 'Australia's World Bank', it set out to fight the big banks of
Europe, North America and Japan on their own ground.
Now Westpac is pulling in its horns, and Mr Conroy openly admits that the
bank would be vulnerable to takeover but for federal government regulations
preventing mergers between the top six financial institutions. Even that
defence will disappear if the opposition conservatives win the election
which must be held by June.
If the rules do change, the most likely bidder is NAB, though Mr Argus is
playing down the prospect. He said last week that NAB was too busy digesting
its recent ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 750.85m) takeover of the Bank of New
Zealand.
However, NAB is known to have looked at both Westpac and the almost equally
weakened Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (ANZ) as possible
targets.
Most bankers and banking analysts think some rationalisation is inevitable.
Even Mr Conroy says the four trading banks are likely to be reduced to
three, though he thinks ANZ is the more likely target. The Commonwealth, the
fourth trading bank, is still in majority government ownership.
The irony is that five years ago, NAB looked likely to be left behind by its
more aggressive rivals. Under the conservative guidance of Mr Argus, then
credit manager, and Mr Will Bailey, chief executive, the bank largely
eschewed the rush into high-risk corporate lending which fuelled Australia's
late 1980s boom.
Mr Argus and Mr Bailey were suspicious of the large-scale treasury
activities which dominated the other banks, preferring to stick to small
loans, especially in the housing sector. They did not get everything right,
however; NAB was exposed to several high-profile corporate casualties,
including Mr John Spalvins' Adsteam group, Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation
Holdings, and Mr John Elliott's Harlin Holdings, formed to take a large
stake in Foster's Brewing.
But NAB has been able to extricate itself with less damage to its balance
sheet than the other banks, largely because it has stuck to a policy of
loaning against cash flow rather than against commercial property assets.
This policy looked cautious five years ago, but it has paid dividends since
the property market began to crash in 1990. 'We are not a property bank,'
says Mr Argus with almost palpable relief. 'We are not interested. We never
have been.' Ironically, NAB's largest single write-down, taken in this
year's second half, was ADollars 126m against its 5 per cent shareholding in
ANZ.
NAB reaped the benefit of its conservative strategy this year, when it
reported a net profit after abnormals of ADollars 675m, maintaining its
consistently profitable record. The bank was able to increase interest
income and cut bad debt provisions in Australia in spite of slow economic
growth, and would have reported substantially higher profits but for
recession-related bad debt charges in the UK and Ireland.
NAB's result was in sharp contrast to ANZ, where Mr Don Mercer, the
Scottish-born chief executive who took over recently from Mr Will Bailey,
was reduced to drawing attention to his accent as an indication that he was
unlikely to squander shareholders' money. ANZ reported a net loss of
ADollars 579m after writing off ADollars 1.9bn against bad and doubtful
debts, and analysts say the bank faces a long, hard slog back to
profitability.
'I guess you could say we partied long into the night (in the 1980s)' says
Mr Mercer. 'What you are seeing today is a bank with a bad hangover. Some of
the guests partied so hard that they didn't survive, but those who did
survive have a thumping headache.'
The bank with the sorest head is undoubtedly Westpac, which has had a truly
awful year. Westpac lost a net ADollars 1.56bn after writing off ADollars
2.66bn against bad debts in an attempt to draw a line under several years of
poor performance. The loss followed the resignation of five directors,
including Sir Eric Neal, the former chairman, who was replaced by Mr John
Uhrig, the no-nonsense chairman of CRA, the Australian mining group.
Mr Uhrig and Mr Frank Conroy, who replaced Mr Stuart Fowler as managing
director earlier this year, have launched an attack on the expense-to-income
ratio, and formally reversed the bank's growth strategy by promising to
reduce assets by ADollars 10bn over three years.
Both Westpac and ANZ went to great lengths to persuade the market that the
worst is over, and both offered evidence to support their case. Westpac, for
example, was able to announce a net profit of ADollars 104m for the second
half, together with a small reduction in gross non-performing loans.
At the very least, the healthy capital adequacy ratios of all three banks
indicate that Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
was right to reassure US investors recently that none of the banks is in any
danger of collapse. However, both Westpac and ANZ say that NAB is using its
financial strength to increase its market share, suggesting that 1980s
tortoise is now firmly among the hares.
