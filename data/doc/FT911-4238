FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Comalco says it faces halved
earnings
COMALCO, the Australian aluminium producer, said yesterday that profits
could be halved this year because of falling world prices.
Mr John Ralph, chairman, said earnings would depend on the outlook for
metals prices, the strength of the Australian dollar, and economic
conditions in Australia and the US.
'If things stay as they are, and we would hope that they don't . . . then we
could easily see profits being halved,' he said after the group's annual
meeting.
Comalco earlier reported net profits of ADollars 177.6m (USDollars 137m) for
the year to December 31, compared with ADollars 308m for the previous year.
The group is 67 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian mining group, which is
49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK.
Mr Ralph said aluminium prices had fallen considerably over the past few
months and were expected to fall further before recovering. The group has
also been badly hit by a fall in demand from the US, caused by the slowing
economy.
Comalco is considering constructing a 1m tonnes per year refinery at Weipa
in north Queensland in a joint venture with Alcan, the Canadian aluminium
producer. However, this and plans to expand smelters in Australia and New
Zealand depend on the slowdown in the leading economies.
