FT  25 MAR 92 / P&amp;O shares rise as it holds fall to 17%
BETTER-than-feared results and the untangling of a property joint venture
helped the share price of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company
jump 32p to 416p yesterday.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 were 17 per cent lower at Pounds 217.4m, but the
City had been expecting a figure of around Pounds 200m. There was also
relief over the ending of the uncertainty surrounding the future of Pall
Mall Properties, P&amp;O's joint venture with Chelsfield, Mr Elliott Bernerd's
private property company.
P&amp;O is to pay Pounds 50.2m for Chelsfield's half share in Pall Mall, which
was set up when the two companies bought Laing Properties in April 1990 for
Pounds 495m. However, Chelsfield is buying back a half share in Laing
Properties, the US business for Pounds 33m. Chelsfield is also buying 40 per
cent of Pall Mall's UK properties for Pounds 181m.
Chelsfield will finance the purchases through a private placement of shares
raising up to Pounds 80m. Of that Pounds 65m has already been tied up
including Pounds 10m from P&amp;O. It is also borrowing Pounds 162m, of which
Pounds 60m is a 10-year subordinated loan with equity warrants.
Mr Bernerd said that with Chelsfield's existing business this would give the
group gross assets of Pounds 340m, financed by Pounds 180m of debt and
Pounds 160m of equity. He said that Chelsfield was now in a position to take
advantage of opportunities in the property sector. He plans to get a quote
for the company either through a listing or a reverse takeover as soon as
practicable, he said.
The effect on P&amp;O will be to bring Pounds 525m of debt on to its balance
sheet, taking gearing from the December 31, 1991 level of 47 per cent to a
pro-forma 70 per cent. Lord Sterling, chairman, said this was 'eminently
comfortable' considering the cashflows from the group's property business.
P&amp;O, the only large UK company to have been set up by Royal Charter, also
announced that it would ask the Privy Council to approve a supplemental
charter allowing overseas investors to invest freely in its shares. Under a
previous supplement dated 1903 there is a 25 per cent limit on foreign
ownership of P&amp;O's shares. Lord Sterling said that at present about 9 per
cent of the shares, were held overseas.
