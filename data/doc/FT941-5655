FT  05 MAR 94 / US set to retaliate in French fish trade dispute
The US is expected to act swiftly in ordering inspection system delays of
French exports in a tit-for-tat trade dispute over US fresh fish exports.
US fisheries say that since February 5, France has blocked fish, shipped in
by air, by instituting a cumbersome inspection and testing regime and other
paperwork requirements.
Exporters have sought to get around the blockade at French airports by air
freighting their products to other European destinations and trucking it
into France. However, they have been warned that this fish too will now be
seized for inspection.
A spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute said trade officials have
promised decisive action quickly under an emergency provision of US trade
law. They said the retaliation is likely to mirror the French actions, with
increased inspections of French products like wine and cheese. The option of
levying import duties remains viable.
The US has drawn up a list of products for retaliation. A decision by Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and President Carter is said to
be imminent.
The French government is said to be responding to strikes and violent
protests by its fishermen against cheap imports. It has offered to lift the
inspections but has yet to act.
US officials said a communication received Wednesday from France was
considered 'non-responsive'.
Because so many of their traditional fish species are 'fished out,' US
fishermen had begun exporting 'under-utilised' species - like skate and
dogfish - which are not popular in the US. Millions of dollars worth have
been left rotting in French storehouses.
