FT  07 SEP 92 / Vietnam accuses China in offshore oil dispute
VIETNAM'S dispute with China over maritime boundaries has worsened, with
Hanoi accusing Beijing at the weekend of establishing an illegal drilling
platform to explore for oil in Vietnamese waters in the Gulf of Tonkin.
China and Vietnam restored 'normal' relations in November after years of
tension, but the rapprochement was quickly soured by territorial disputes on
land and at sea.
In May, China signed an agreement with Crestone Energy of the US to explore
for oil in an area of the South China Sea between Vietnam and Malaysia and
1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam said the zone was on
its continental shelf.
The latest dispute concerns a Chinese rig and seismic survey ships working
off the northern Vietnamese province of Thai Binh in the Gulf of Tonkin.
'I think China will have to respond to the Vietnamese requests for an
immediate halt to the oil-drilling and other activities in Vietnam's
territorial waters,' Mr Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy foreign minister, told
Reuters at the non-aligned summit in Jakarta.
Asked if Vietnam would use force, he said: 'We do not want to seem as if we
are preparing for confrontation. The question of territorial sovereignty is
sacred to every nation.'
On Saturday the Chinese foreign ministry said the Chinese ships were
exploring in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. 'This is not something new,
but the continuation of the oil exploration that has been going on there for
quite some time,' it said.
Even if Hanoi wanted to retaliate, Vietnam's navy is apparently too weak to
mount operations against Chinese incursions or deter further encroachments.
Instead, Vietnam is seeking common cause with other countries concerned
about possible Chinese expansionism.
