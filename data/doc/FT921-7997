FT  19 FEB 92 / French Gaullists will try to block Maastricht pact
FRANCE'S Gaullists have served notice that they will campaign against the
terms of the Maastricht treaty recently signed by the European Community.
Their main objection, as set out this week by Mr Alain Juppe, the party's
secretary general, is to the provision for extending the vote in local
elections to nationals from other EC countries.
'It is completely out of the question to give foreigners the possibility of
having municipal councillors, who could then endorse a candidate for the
presidency, elect senators or become mayor,' Mr Juppe said on radio.
The party also objects to the explicit target of a single European currency,
at the end of the process of European monetary union. It would be better, Mr
Juppe argued, to develop a 13th single currency, rather than 'rush into an
adventure whose consequences we cannot assess'.
He also demanded that the treaty be coupled with an amendment to the French
constitution, to give parliament a greater role in decisions on Community
legislation.
After several years of the party acquiescing without enthusiasm in President
Francois Mitterrand's European policy, these objections to the Maastricht
treaty represent a clear-cut reversion to the traditional nationalism of
Gaullism.
In the short run, this will make it easier for the Gaullists to adopt a
frankly nationalist position in next month's regional elections, and thus
compete more openly for the nationalist vote now swinging towards the
extreme right-wing National Front.
But it is not yet clear whether the Gaullists, even in tacit alliance with
the Front, can mobilise an effective opposition to ratification of the
treaty. If the other half of the conservative opposition, the centre-right
UDF group, sticks to its traditional principles, it will support the treaty,
virtually assuring ratification.
