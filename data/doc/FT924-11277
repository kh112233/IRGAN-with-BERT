FT  27 OCT 92 / Israelis strike at Lebanon guerrilla bases
ISRAELI aircraft and artillery bombarded Shia Moslem villages in southern
Lebanon yesterday in retaliation for a weekend guerrilla attack in which
five soldiers were killed and five wounded.
Israel later widened its assault last night with gunboat raids on
Palestinian targets in north Lebanon.
The Israelis also deployed military reinforcements in its occupied zone
inside Lebanon, where the weekend attack by Iranian-backed Hizbollah forces
occurred.
The shelling by Israel and its militia allies of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA) extended across almost the width of Lebanon, from the Mediterranean in
the west to the lower Bekaa Valley in the east. A UN source said 200 shells
exploded in just an hour around the market town of Nabatiyeh and in the
Bekaa.
Israeli helicopter gunships raided two villages, including Kfar Tibnit, a
staging ground for Iranian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas. At least eight
Lebanese civilians were reported wounded. Lebanese-based guerrillas also
fired rockets into Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in the southern
part of the territory.
An Israeli military spokesman said gunboats later attacked 'terrorist
targets' near the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in north Lebanon. Israel
claimed Palestinians from this camp had carried out guerrilla attacks in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Israeli assault against targets in Lebanon was the fiercest since
February.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, addressing the opening winter session of
parliament, held both Syria and the Lebanese movements responsible for
latest guerrilla attacks on Israeli targets.
'It's hard to understand how they (Syria) on the one hand are involved in
negotiations with us, and on the other hand, permit this kind of action,'
said Mr Rabin.
