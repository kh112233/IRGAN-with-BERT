REGIONAL EARNINGS: 2ND-QUARTER NET INCOME SOARS 266% FOR AMGEN 
Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, said its net income soared 
266% to $14.3 million in the second quarter that ended Sept. 30 from $3.9 
million a year before. Amgen attributed the huge jump to sales of its drug for 
the treatment of chronic anemia in kidney dialysis patients. 
The drug, called Epogen, was approved for sale by the Food and Drug 
Administration in June, 1989. Amgen said its total revenues for the second 
quarter nearly doubled to $78.8 million, from $39.6 million last year. 
For the first half of Amgen's fiscal year, the company's profit increased more 
than fivefold to $25.5 million, from $4.7 million a year ago. Amgen's six 
months' sales more than doubled to $150.5 million, from $68.1 million.
