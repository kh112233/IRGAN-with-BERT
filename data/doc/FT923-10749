FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology loss doubles to
Pounds 11.6m
BRITISH Bio-technology, the recently floated pharmaceuticals group,
yesterday reported losses before tax for the year ended April 30 almost
doubled from Pounds 6.13m to Pounds 11.6m.
Mr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said the results were in line with
expectations. Product research and development expenditure was likely to
increase from about Pounds 11.5m in 1991 to about Pounds 15m this year, he
said. This would lead to losses about 50 per cent higher for the current
year.
Losses per share increased from 34.9p to 44.9p. The company is not paying a
dividend.
Net cash outflow was Pounds 12m (Pounds 10m), partly because of increased
spending. However, revenues fell from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.1m.
Mr McCullagh said this followed a decision to push through more research to
the development stage, allowing the company to generate more substantial
revenues at a later date.
The balance sheet remained strong with cash reserves of more than Pounds 37m
at the year end, he said. This had been increased to Pounds 60m following
the flotation, and would allow the group to extend its clinical trial
programme.
Mr McCullagh said the group's strategy was to sell the marketing rights for
medicines that would be prescribed by general practitioners, but keep the UK
and possibly European rights for products to be sold into hospitals. These
drugs required smaller, less expensive, sales forces.
British Bio-technology would be looking to sign a co-development and
marketing deal, late this year or early next year, with a significant
pharmaceuticals company for its Aids vaccine. The drug has completed phase I
safety trials on healthy volunteers and the group is hoping to establish its
efficacy with further trials.
