FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Vymura Pounds 10m placing to repay backers
Vymura, the wallcoverings company which is floating next month with a value
of about Pounds 40m, is looking to raise about Pounds 10m via a share
placing handled by BZW and UBS.
Just over half the money will be used to repay preference shares held by
institutions who backed a management buy-out in 1992.
Vymura's operating profits rose by almost 40 per cent to Pounds 3.96m last
year and the pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, reveals that sales
to DIY superstores have seen 'significant increases' in the first quarter.
Mr Tom Smail, chief executive, said: 'We budgeted for strong sales and have
seen them, though we still have to see what the real impact of the tax
increases will be.'
He believes the company has room to grow in the UK, where it has some 14 per
cent of the market, and even greater opportunities overseas.
The placing price is expected to be announced on May 5.
