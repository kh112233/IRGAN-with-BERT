THE NUMBER of business failures notified to Trade Indemnity, the trade
credit insurer, fell in the fourth quarter of last year, confirming the
company's earlier view that the recession is bottoming out, Richard Lapper
writes.
According to provisional figures business failures in the three months
ending December 31 totalled 1,953, 7 per cent less than the 2,100 in the
third quarter.
The overall level of failures is still 49 per cent higher than in 1990.
Business failures for the year as a whole were 72 per cent higher than in
1990.
Mr Charles McCartan, Trade Indemnity associate director, stressed that
failures figare a lagging indicator of recovery.
