FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Willis warned over EETPU poaching
LEADERS FROM 11 unions representing a majority of votes on the general
council of the Trade Union Congress yesterday warned Mr Norman Willis, the
TUC leader, that poaching by the EETPU electricians union will not be
tolerated if the union rejoins the TUC.
Many of the 11 unions, most of which have had disputes with the EETPU either
before or since it was expelled in 1988, welcome its return after its merger
with the AEU engineering union.
Some insist, however, that as a pre-condition of return the EETPU must 'hand
back' groups of workers it has recruited from TUC unions. That will be
difficult to enforce, especially if the Conservatives win the election and
outlaw the TUC's Bridlington agreement, which governs union membership
disputes.
If serious attempts are made to block the return of the EETPU some AEU
factions would probably favour leaving the TUC too, rather than jeopardise
the merger. The Labour election campaign could be disrupted by a dispute
looming between the TGWU general workers union and its 700 office staff who
play an important role in Labour electioneering in some constituencies. The
staff have voted by 509 to 203 for a one-day strike next week.
