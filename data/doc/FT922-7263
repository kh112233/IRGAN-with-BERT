FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks take their cue from
overseas
Wall Street
US STOCK markets took their cue from overseas yesterday, share prices rising
with relief that the Olympia &amp; York bankruptcy situation did not do more
damage to international financial markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed an improvement of 22.94
at 3,376.03.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index moved forward 2.72 to
412.81, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose
2.10 to 576.53. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 151.4m shares.
No one factor dominated market sentiment yesterday, although the mild
reaction of international markets to O &amp; Y's troubles helped US equities
bounce back from two consecutive days of losses.
The market was also helped by yet another fall in bond yields, and by
growing hopes of an interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve's key
policy-making Open Market Committee meets today, and if a decision is taken
to ease monetary policy once more, it is likely to be agreed upon at the
meeting, said analysts.
Among individual stocks, Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 74
3/8 in turnover of some 1.3m shares after the computer group posted fiscal
second-quarter net income of Dollars 1.28 cents a share, up from 93 cents a
year ago.
The market was not unsettled by the figures, but by the company's expression
of concern about the sluggishness of economic conditions and its effect on
earnings.
Hewlett-Packard's warning appeared to trouble other computer stocks,
probably contributing to IBM's poor performance on a day when other leading
stocks shone. IBM finished Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 90 5/8 .
Elsewhere in the sector, Motorola retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 ,
Compaq lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 and Digital Equipment slipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 , but Unisys steadied at Dollars 9 1/4 .
Clothing retailer The Gap rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34 3/4 as the market
began to claw back some of the fall incurred last week in the wake of
disappointing first-quarter profits.
Deere &amp; Co weakened Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/2 in heavy trading after
analysts at two broking houses, Smith Barney and Prudential Securities,
reduced their estimates of the agricultural equipment maker's fiscal 1992
earnings.
McDonnell Douglas was down a sharp Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 on
reports that Taiwan Aerospace will propose altering the terms of a joint
venture with McDonnell which will involve the elimination, at least for now,
of a planned equity infusion.
Barnett Banks lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 after announcing it will
take a charge to cover the costs of its Dollars 885m stock swap merger with
First Florida Banks. The news sent First Florida shares rocketing Dollars 13
7/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 on the Nasdaq market.
Airgas climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 after reporting fiscal
fourth-quarter net income of 33 cents a share, reversing last year's final
quarter loss of 51 cents a share.
On the over-the-counter market, Stokely declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 6
1/8 after the company suspended its dividend on common stock in the wake of
a fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
Toronto was closed yesterday for Victoria Day.
