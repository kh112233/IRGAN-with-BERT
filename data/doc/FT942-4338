FT  10 JUN 94 / Howard refuses to ease drug law
Mr Michael Howard yesterday ruled out the legalisation of any banned drug on
the grounds that such a move would lead to more addiction.
The home secretary told top police officers that the maintenance of
international solidarity against drug misuse was vital.
He also ruled out the de-criminalisation of drugs. To decide not to enforce
certain laws while leaving them on the statute book risked bringing 'the
whole of the criminal law into disrepute'.
His remarks to the Association of Chief Police Officers drugs conference in
Wakefield came a day after both Mr Raymond Kendall, secretary-general of
Interpol, and Mr Keith Hellawell, chief constable of West Yorkshire police,
backed decriminalisation as a means of tackling the drug problem.
Mr Howard said: 'This government has no intention of legalising any
currently banned drug. To do so would be bound to increase the human and
social damage, especially that inflicted on the young.'
Signalling a possible new clampdown on drug dealers at street level, Mr
Howard said enforcement activity was most effective when immediately
followed by 'environmental changes'.
These might include the wholesale demolition of drug-dealing areas, as well
as improving street lighting and traffic management.
Mr Howard said that the Metropolitan Police's crackdown on drug dealing and
prostitution in the King's Cross area of north London in 1992 was one
example of where a co-ordinated approach had had a significant impact.
But he said enforcement and other 'supply-side measures' would never alone
solve the drugs problem.
Welcoming the introduction of drugs education into the national curriculum,
he said the government should help young people and other high-risk groups
to resist becoming involved with drugs.
