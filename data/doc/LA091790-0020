On the Ropes: Sugar Ray Leonard, who rarely lost in the ring, has been dealt a 
blow in divorce court. Judge William Miller in Rockville, Md., has ruled that 
Leonard must turn over financial records to attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who is

Mitchelson, asked if he is concerned about facing the pugilist, quipped: "If I 
was in the ring, I would be." 
Dog Design: Barbara Bush was presented in Washington late last week with an 
outfit specially designed for White House dog Millie. The outfit, designed by

Cooked Book: Washington author Adrian Havill is writing a book on sports empire 
builder Jack Kent Cooke, but Havill thinks the self-made, often-abrasive owner 
of the Washington Redskins may not cooperate on a book he doesn't control.

Rancho Resale: A New Hampshire real estate company plans to buy the former 
ranch-commune home of the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Hanover 
Investment Corp. put down an undisclosed deposit on the 64,229-acre, $6-million 
central Oregon property, which the firm may turn into a health spa. The commune 
folded in 1985, after the Rolls Royce-loving Rajneesh was convicted of 
immigration fraud and deported to India, where he died in January.
