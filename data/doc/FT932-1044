FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology: Topping up the hormones - The market for
menopause treatment is lucrative, says Clive Cookson in a series on drug
discoveries
A 51-year-old product, extracted from pregnant mares' urine, is turning
unexpectedly into a pharmaceutical blockbuster. The success of Premarin -
worldwide sales up 20 per cent to Dollars 642m (Pounds 428m) last year and
projected to reach Dollars 1bn in 1995 - is a testimony to the fast-growing
popularity of hormone replacement therapy for women during and after the
menopause.
Although HRT has been going as long as an average menopausal woman, new
research findings are propelling its growth. They show that oestrogens such
as Premarin not only relieve the immediate symptoms of menopause, such as
hot flushes, night sweats, fatigue and vaginal dryness, but also help
prevent two serious health problems of old age: osteoporosis (fragile bones)
and heart disease.
At the same time drug companies are developing more convenient ways of
delivering HRT than the traditional Premarin tablets sold by Wyeth, the
pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Home Products. The most important
innovation is the transdermal patch, pioneered by Ciba of Switzerland, which
releases hormones slowly into the blood through the skin.
Menopause is defined narrowly as a woman's last menstrual period, which
occurs at an average age of 51, but the term is now used more loosely to
describe the change triggered by the ovaries' declining capacity to produce
oestrogens (female sex hormones). Typically this starts in the late 40s and
continues well into the 50s.
Falling oestrogen levels affect the normal functioning of many body systems,
including skin, bone, blood vessels and sex organs. The most important
long-term impact is to accelerate the normal age-related loss of bone
density and minerals. The result is osteoporosis, which causes 1.3m bone
fractures a year in the US, at a total cost in health care estimated at
Dollars 10bn a year. More than half the women who break a hip in old age
will never be able to walk without assistance again and one in five dies
within a year of the fracture.
Menopause also removes the protection from heart disease given by
oestrogens, which reduce clogging of arteries and simulate the healthy
growth of blood vessels. Although younger women are much less likely than
men of the same age to die from heart attack or stroke, such deaths increase
rapidly after the age of 50.
HRT aims to restore oestrogens in the blood to a level slightly below what
is normal before menopause. Although Wyeth and Ciba dominate the market,
more than 20 other HRT products are currently available, including surgical
implants, creams and pessaries as well as tablets and skin patches. Most
contain natural oestrogens - either human oestradiol or 'conjugated
oestrogens' from pregnant mares. These are much less potent than the
synthetic hormones incorporated in oral contraceptive pills.
In addition to oestrogen, women on HRT whose wombs have not been removed by
hysterectomy are advised to take cyclical doses of a second hormone,
progestogen. Its role is to prevent excessive cells building up in the
lining of the uterus - a condition that can eventually lead to cancer of the
womb.
Clinical evidence for the long-term benefits of HRT is building up steadily,
as the World Menopause Congress in Stockholm has been hearing this week. The
risk of hip fracture is reduced by at least half after five years of
treatment and the risk of heart attack may be cut by 45 per cent.
The proportion of menopausal women in the UK who are on HRT has increased
from 4 per cent to 9 per cent over the past five years, according to the
Amarant Trust, a medical charity specialising in HRT. In the US about 15 per
cent are on HRT.
However, there is scope for far more women to benefit from HRT, says Val
Godfree, deputy medical director of the Amarant Trust. Busy family doctors
do not have time to explain HRT during the 10 to 15 minutes allotted to a
typical consultation, she says, or to work out the best therapy for each
individual. As a result, too many women give up after two or three weeks
because of the 'side-effects', before the therapy has had a chance to do
them much good.
The side-effects caused by oestrogen-progestogen combinations - including
breast tenderness, bloating and leg cramps - normally disappear within three
months, as the body becomes accustomed to the raised hormone levels. It may
also be possible to reduce side-effects by switching to a different
combination and/or from tablets to skin patch.
Beyond the immediate side-effects, some women steer clear of HRT because
they are afraid of the long-term risks of hormone consumption and/or because
they think it is wrong to interfere artificially with the natural ageing
process - a view that the author Germaine Greer expounded in her anti-HRT
book The Change, published in 1991. (Books about the menopause are a
lucrative publishing genre; Gail Sheehy's The Silent Passage, which favours
HRT, headed the US bestseller lists last year.)
Potentially the most serious long-term risk of HRT is a small increase in
the chance of developing breast cancer. This is still medically
controversial but Godfree concedes that the risk of breast cancer may
increase from 1-in-12 to 1-in-9 after 15 years on HRT.
Women who do not like taking sex hormones but still want to protect
themselves against osteoporosis may be prescribed other bone-strengthening
drugs, notably calcitonins.
Giving calcium (the main mineral in bone) directly as a dietary supplement
does not appear to prevent osteoporosis in well-nourished women. But
calcitonins - hormones that regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the
body - do help by reducing the resorption of mineral from bone into the
blood.
Sandoz of Switzerland leads the Dollars 1bn-a-year calcitonin market with
Miacalcic, a synthetic version of salmon calcitonin. Until recently,
calcitonins had to be injected but Miacalcic is now available as a more
convenient nasal spray.
Bisphosphonates - potent inhibitors of bone resorption - are a new category
of drug to treat osteoporosis. Sales are still small - only Dollars 80m last
year according to Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta and Isaly, the New
York healthcare investment company - but they are expected to rise as new
products come through clinical trials.
Meanwhile, a new generation of transdermal patches will be fuelling the
growth of the HRT market. The first, Evorel, was launched in Europe early
this year by Ortho-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. As with Ciba's
original Estraderm, a patch is applied twice a week to the buttocks or top
of the legs. But with a thickness of only 0.1 mm, Evorel is thinner than
Estraderm; it contains oestrogen dispersed in a matrix rather than a liquid
reservoir. Ortho-Cilag quotes clinical studies to show that Evorel suffers
less from two problems of the first-generation patches - their tendency to
fall off and to irritate the skin.
Other companies developing second-generation HRT patches include two US drug
delivery companies, Noven and Cignus, and Ethical Holdings of the UK. Noven
has signed licencing agreements with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in Europe and Ciba
in the US, while Cignus is collaborating with Warner-Lambert.
The main advantage of patches over tablets, apart from convenience, is that
the hormone diffuses straight into the bloodstream. 'The patch avoids giving
large doses of oestrogen to the liver,' says John Stevenson, consultant
endocrinologist at the Wynn Institute for Metabolic Research. 'It is
therefore less likely to cause metabolic disturbances which might be seen
with the oral route.'
Menopause-related drugs are one of the fastest growing of all pharmaceutical
sectors, as Desai points out. Ironically, the growth is based less on new
chemicals than on well-known natural hormones.
Desai expects the overall market for menopause, osteoporosis and bone
disease treatments to continue growing at 15 to 20 per cent a year at least
until 1996 - 'and the rate of expansion could be even faster if sufficient
breadth of new products was available'.
The series will continue next month with an article on arthritis treatment.
