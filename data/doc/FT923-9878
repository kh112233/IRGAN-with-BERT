FT  03 AUG 92 / East Kent seeks assisted status
EMPLOYMENT blackspots in east Kent are campaigning to become the first parts
of south-east England to be granted assisted-area status to improve job
prospects.
Successive studies have confirmed that east Kent is facing a period of
significant structural change to employment, partly because of the planned
opening of the Channel tunnel next year. That will place such severe
pressure on the local economy that it will find it difficult to respond to
any general uplift in economic performance within the south-east or across
the country as a whole.
The public and private sectors have joined together in an east Kent
initiative under the chairmanship of Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of
Eurotunnel, to establish a programme for action and to press for the
benefits that assis-ted-area status would bring.
They include infrastructure grants for industrial estates to create jobs,
grants for the capital cost of equipment, regional enterprise grants for
small companies, a greater prospect of developing industrial estates for
sale or rent, and, possibly most valuable of all, a much increased chance of
receiving European Community grants.
Worst affected areas are Thanet, with 14.2 per cent unemployment, Swale
(Sittingbourne and Sheerness) with 11.2 per cent, and Shepway (Folkestone,
Hythe and Romney Marsh) with 10.5 per cent. Dover also expects big job
losses because of the tunnel's effects on ferry and construction jobs and
the effect of the EC single market on Customs employment.
Supporters of the initiative say there is a strong case for assisted-area
status as Thanet, for example, has a higher unemployment rate than 15 of the
21 development areas in England and more than all 26 intermediate areas.
The government is expected to choose recipients of assisted-area status in
the autumn.
