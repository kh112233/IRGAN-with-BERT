FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Throgmorton USM accepts purchase offer from
new trust
THE board of Throgmorton USM Trust, a smaller companies investment trust,
yesterday announced that it had accepted a purchase offer from a newly
formed investment trust, to be named Throgmorton 1000 Smallest Companies
Trust.
Throgmorton 1000 has arranged to raise Pounds 12m by a placing of ordinary
shares with warrants attached, and it is estimated that the trust's net
assets will be approximately Pounds 37.1m after the offer for the trust and
placing have been completed.
Throgmorton USM shareholders will be offered Throgmorton 1000 shares
equivalent to 100 per cent of the value of Throgmorton USM's formula asset
value. Its net asset value attributable to shareholders at the end of last
year was Pounds 24.46m.
Another offer is being made to Throgmorton USM warrant holders.
Throgmorton USM was due to be wound up after next year's annual general
meeting, expected in April. Advisers to Throgmorton USM say the deal allows
current shareholders the opportunity either to continue their investment in
a vehicle which shares a similar investment philosophy, or to realise their
investment for cash at a price close to the formula asset value.
The new company will invest in around 100 companies, selected from the 1000
smallest UK quoted companies.
According to the timetable, the preference offer for Throgmorton USM is
assumed to become unconditional on July 23.
