  [Text] In order to observe the dynamic features of 
physiological function of human body during the initial stage of 
space flight and to study the mechanism of ``space adaptation 
syndrome,'' the heart beat, respiration, head and leg body 
surface temperatures and EEG were observed in 12 subjects during 
head-down 6 bed-rest. All the indices were recorded in a 
physiological data acquisition and processing system for our 
bed-rest laboratory. Analysis items include the trend of heart 
rate, body temperatures, respiration and EEG during 24h 
bed-rest, R-R spectrum and EEG power spectrum. 
  The results showed that some important physiological 
functions such as heart beat, respiration and EEG, still 
remained circadian during head-down bed-rest. But some extent 
disorders appeared, i.e. (1) Two peaks of heart beat rhythm 
which appear in normal condition disappeared and phase of heart 
beat rhythm shifted. (2) The circadian rhythm of body 
temperature was changed. The rhythm in head surface temperature 
disappeared and the surface temperature in leg increased 
significantly in the initial several hours, then decreased, and 
the fluctuation was remarkable. (3) The power in _a_ band 
decreased and the power in  and _th_ band increased during 
bed-rest. The biorhythmic analysis indicated a decrease of 
circadian rhythm stability and showed a phase shifting. The 
results of R-R spectrum and EEG power spectrum showed that the 
regulation of heart and brain and cerebral cortical activities 
were changed during 24h bed-rest.
