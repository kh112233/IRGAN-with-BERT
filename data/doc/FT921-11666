FT  30 JAN 92 / Insurers unwilling to back investors' scheme
INSURERS are no longer willing to provide cover for the investors'
compensation scheme, a safety net for private investors set up under the
Financial Services Act.
The unwillingness of the insurance market to back the scheme, which pays out
up to Pounds 100m a year, is one of the reasons for a review of the
compensation arrangements which was announced yesterday by the Securities
and Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog.
Privately regulators have told the life assurance and unit trust industries
they will have to pay an additional Pounds 14m into the scheme for the
1991-92 fiscal year. The payment is to help the independent financial
advisers regulated by Fimbra to meet their contribution, which can be up to
Pounds 19m. Earnings of these independent advisers are modest compared with
those of the life assurance and unit trust industries which are regulated by
Lautro.
Regulators believed the high cost of running the compensation scheme would
drive the independent advisers out of business.
The lack of insurance cover for the scheme's next financial year, which
begins in April, does not mean that investors will be unprotected. However,
it leaves investment firms liable for the full Pounds 100m in any one year -
a potential liability that has led to the review of the three-year-old
scheme.
