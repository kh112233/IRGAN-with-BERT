FT  02 NOV 93 / Alliance drawn into peace talks
SOUTH AFRICA'S right-wing Freedom Alliance yesterday agreed to meet the
government to try to hammer out a last-minute compromise on a new
constitution, while the ultra-left Pan Africanist Congress took a further
step toward renouncing violence, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The government and the Freedom Alliance, which includes the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party and white supremacist groups, will meet for two days
from today at a secret bush venue. The government will make a last-ditch
effort to persuade the alliance to accept a draft constitution due to be
adopted by multi-party negotiators. The deadline for multi-party adoption of
the constitution was pushed back to November 12.
The government is also pressing the PAC, which has participated in
multi-party constitutional talks, to end its violent struggle against
apartheid. The two sides met yesterday in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare,
and issued a communique calling for a moratorium on violence but stopping
short of agreeing the government's demand that the PAC halt its guerrilla
war. The Azanian People's Liberation Army, the PAC's military wing, has
claimed responsibility for recent murders of whites.
