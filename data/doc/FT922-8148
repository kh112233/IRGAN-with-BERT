FT  14 MAY 92 / George warns on single EC currency
A WARNING about the practical difficulties involved in the move to a single
European currency was delivered last night by Mr Eddie George, deputy
governor of the Bank of England.
In a speech at Hull University, Mr George questioned both the timetable for
European economic and monetary union, and the credibility of the proposed
European Central Bank.
The remarks by Mr George - a noted sceptic on Emu - may influence MPs ahead
of next week's Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty, which last December
set the general framework for a move to union later this decade.
Mr George also held out little prospect of any early move by the government
to reduce base rates further, following last week's 0.5 percentage point
reduction to 10 per cent. In the longer term he hinted at the possibility of
bringing UK rates lower than those in Germany, on condition that Britain
kept its inflation low and retained the confidence of the financial markets.
On Emu, Mr George said practical difficulties meant the schedule as set out
at Maastricht looked ambitious. Under the Maastricht plan, the final stage
of Emu will start up with or without Britain by 1999.
The problems included converting national currencies into European currency
units, and producing the necessary coins and notes. Another was establishing
Ecu payments systems.
Mr George was particularly sceptical about the operation of the proposed
central bank. It is planned that in the final stages of Emu the bank would
administer the single currency and set pan-European interest rates.
He said that the central bank might be 'vulnerable to misjudgment and to
outside influence'.
In terms of determining the correct level of interest rates, the central
bank would be faced with huge problems in monitoring how factors such as
financial liberalisation affected the pan-European economy.
