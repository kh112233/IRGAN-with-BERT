ENVIRONMENTALISTS BUY ECUADOR DEBT IN SWAP 
Environmentalists bought off $9 million of Ecuador's debt on in the largest 
"debt for nature swap" ever signed. 
Under the agreement, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy will 
buy from American Express Co. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. $9 million of 
Ecuador's debt at a discount of 11.875 cents on the dollar, putting the total 
cost to the group at $1.07 million. 
The commercial bank debt will be converted, one-for-one, by the Ecuador Central 
Bank into local currency bonds that will be spent for conserving Ecuador's 
dwindling rain forests. 
"Debt becomes not so much a burden as an opportunity to kill two birds with one 
stone -- debt and conservation," said Sen. Robert Kasten, a Wisconsin 
Republican who is co-sponsoring a bill that would expand debt-for-nature swaps.
