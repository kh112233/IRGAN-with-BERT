FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (8): The inflow accelerates - Foreign
investment
Foreigners accounted for more than half the EEK2,540m (Dollars 195m) of new
investment in the Estonian economy over the first nine months of 1993 with
Finland and the Scandinavian countries in the lead. The inflow is expected
to quicken in 1994 with the speeding up of privatisation and a possible 4-5
per cent rise in GDP.
Investment mirrors the trade pattern. Over the first nine months of 1993,
Finland - with EEK45.7m invested in 502 Estonian enterprises - topped the
league followed by the US with EEK35.5m in 31 enterprises.
US investors include PepsiCo, although the largest US investor is a company
owned by Mrs Tivu Silves, an Estonian entrepreneur with subsidiaries in the
US.
Swedish companies, eager to secure a lower cost production base invested
EEK31m in 94 enterprises although their presence is actually greater because
many Swedish companies, including Asea Brown Boveri, operate through their
Finnish subsidiaries.
Italy comes fourth with EEK23m, but virtually all of that is accounted for
by one big investment, the HTM Sport Estonia ski boot and accessory factory.
Germany completes the list of the top five foreign investors with EEK12m in
35 companies while the bulk of the EEK8m invested by UK companies is
accounted for by Shell, the oil company. Russian entrepreneurs invested
EEK7.9m in 76 companies.
Several big projects are in the pipeline however with Sumitomo Bank of Japan
involved in financing the big new container and oil port at Muuga, just
outside Tallinn.
Other foreign investments include:
A Dollars 10m investment by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in a
Dollars 44m project to modernise and clean up the 1m tonne a year Kunda
Nordic Cement plant. Kunda is jointly owned by the Estonian government and
Atlas Nordic Cement, controlled by Euroc of Sweden and Switzerland's
Holderbank.
Modernisation of the telecommunications network, including a FMk100m mobile
phone system and a ten-year Dollars 50m fixed line project for 600,000
lines. Joint venture between the Estonian government (51 per cent) and
Telecoms Finland and Swedish Telea, with 24.5 per cent each.
Electrolux of Sweden - a plant to produce 80,000 electric cookers.
