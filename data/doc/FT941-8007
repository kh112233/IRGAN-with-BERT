FT  22 FEB 94 / Advertising by Church gets go-ahead
The Church of England was yesterday given approval to launch advertising
campaigns with other churches to spread the Christian message.
Internal policymakers ruled there was no ethical bar to advertising -
provided it was used in co-operation with other denominations. They said
advertising could be a 'creative, effective, appropriate, even amusing'
means of getting the Christian message across. But it should only be used as
part of an overall communications strategy.
A report by a working party of the Church of England's Communications
Committee found there was no agreed plan between dioceses.
It said: 'Since the communication of the Christian Gospel is of paramount
importance we find this state of affairs to be a matter of deep regret. The
church gives far too low a priority to its thinking and budgeting on
reaching those who do not hear its message.'
The working party, which was set up to consider the ethical and theological
considerations of advertising, was chaired by Canon Colin Semper, a former
BBC head of religious broadcasting. Its members included a moral theologian,
an advertising agent, a diocesan communications officer and the director of
the Roman Catholic Communications Centre.
The Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch, bishop of Wakefield and chairman of the church's
communications committee, said: 'This report is seminal. It identifies the
key questions to be asked about the use of advertising and suggests
guidelines for the church.'
A Church of England priest yesterday failed in his challenge to the legality
of the ordination of women priests.
The Rev Paul Williamson, priest-in-charge of St George's, Hanworth, west
London, asked for a High Court injunction to stop members of the General
Synod voting through the change at a meeting today.
Mr Justice Popplewell rejected the application and refused Mr Williamson
permission to seek a judicial review.
