FT  08 JAN 93 / Reich will seek better jobs for non-graduates
THE US must do more to improve the career prospects of the three quarters of
Americans who do not graduate from college, Mr Robert Reich, labour
secretary-designate, said in Senate confirmation hearings yesterday. The
task was not just to create more jobs but higher-quality ones.
He expected the Labour Department to play a more prominent economic role in
the new administration. Global economic integration meant the 'American
workforce is coming to be the American economy'.
Mr Reich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, provided much of
the intellectual input for President-elect Bill Clinton's economic plan,
Putting People First. Having known Mr Clinton well since both were at Oxford
in the 1960s, he is expected to enjoy greater access to the president than
previous labour secretaries.
Mr Reich said his first goal was to provide a path to good jobs for the 75
per cent of young people who do not complete four years of college. This
involved easing the 'school to work' transition for less academic students
and putting greater emphasis on certification and standards so 'employers
know what they are getting'.
Other goals would include helping displaced workers find new jobs and
fostering business organisations that provided career ladders for less well
educated employees.
He also intended to promote 'family friendly' employment. US employers
needed to pay more attention to issues like parental leave, child care,
elder care and pensions.
Mr Reich said the US also needed to review unemployment insurance provisions
which had been designed to cater for short business cycle fluctuations. Much
unemployment today tended to be long-term and structural.
