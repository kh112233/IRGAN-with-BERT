FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: VW may take stake in Japanese
car importer
TRADING in shares of Jax, the importer and distributor of Renault cars in
Japan, was suspended yesterday on reports that Volkswagen of Germany is
acquiring a significant stake in the financially troubled dealer group.
VW has been looking for an alternative network to replace a long-standing
partnership with the Yanase car distribution group which is ceasing from the
end of this year.
Renault, meanwhile, is investigating the use of the Japanese sales network
of its partner Volvo, with which it has cross-shareholdings.
Volvo has already expressed its readiness to help Renault. Volvo set up
Volvo Cars Japan as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1986, at about the same
time as Renault was concluding its deal with Jax.
Tokyo-based Jax, whose shares are traded over the counter, described the
deal as a 'tie up', but reports suggested it would issue new shares for
allotment to VW, which will eventually hold a 30 to 40 per cent stake.
VW itself acknowledged last night that links with Jax were in prospect but
made no details available.
Jax is currently the sole distributor for Renault, but has seen sluggish
sales due to the fall in consumer spending.
The company posted a pre-tax loss of Y968m (Dollars 7.85m), on a 3.2 per
cent fall in sales, for the six months to June, and overall borrowings
totalled 91.6 per cent of its assets at the end of last June.
According to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association, imported car sales
are expected to fall 8.7 per cent from the previous year to 180,000 units.
