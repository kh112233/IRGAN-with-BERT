SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
D.A. HONORS 3 RESIDENTS 
Three residents from Azusa, Covina and Pasadena who helped in the arrests of 
crime suspects were among eight Los Angeles-area residents honored by Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner on Monday. 
The fifth annual Courageous Citizens Award ceremony held at Pasadena Superior 
Court is part of an on-going program to recognize civilians who assist in the 
capture or conviction of criminals. 
Diana Jean LaFrenierre, 40, of Azusa was driving home in 1987 when she saw a 
man hovering over a body in Los Angeles. When the man drove away with an 
accomplice, LaFrenierre gave chase at speeds exceeding 80 m.p.h. until both 
cars were stopped by police. Her testimony later helped obtain murder 
convictions of both men. 
Patrick M. Clisham, 43, of Covina witnessed a sexual assault in a Covina 
laundry one night in 1987 and noted the license plate number of the suspect's 
car as he fled. Police later arrested the man. 
Robert Nembhard , 35, an RTD driver from Pasadena and Jose Lechuga, 23, of Los 
Angeles chased two suspects who robbed a 76-year-old man on a bus last year. 
Their testimony helped obtain convictions.
