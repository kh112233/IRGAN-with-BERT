FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Clyde Blowers Pounds 141,000 in red
After reorganisation costs of Pounds 151,000, Clyde Blowers ran into a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 141,000 in the year ended August 31 1992, against a
profit of Pounds 254,000.
Although turnover rose to Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 4.34m) there was a swing from
an operating profit of Pounds 93,000 to a deficit of Pounds 253,000.
However, increased investment income of Pounds 263,500 (Pounds 161,000) cut
that to Pounds 10,000, before the reorganisation costs.
The overall result was 'very much as anticipated' considering the scale of
the reorganisation, said the directors.
The year past had been, and the current term would continue to be, a period
of significant change for the company.
Losses per share worked through at 4.76p (earnings 18p). However, the
dividend is held at 7.9p, the final being 7.07p, payable January 13.
