The yearly average quantity of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated
to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 199394 MY was approximately 220,000
pounds. The average annual quantity produced in the United States and exported during the same period was approximately
120,000 pounds (farm sales weight basis). Domestic use has shown a sharp downward trend, and exports have shown a moderate
downward trend. Accordingly, a quantity of 92,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's domestic consumption
and a quantity of 20,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's exports. Application of the formula prescribed
by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 300,000 pounds.

Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 200,000
pounds. The 1993 Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco crop is estimated to be 100,000 pounds. Therefore, the total
supply of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 300,000 pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated
that disappearance will total approximately 120,000 pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply,
a carryover of 180,000 pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 120,000 pounds.
This represents the quantity of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available
during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Around 90 percent of the announced national marketing quota
is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds
is necessary to make available production of 120,000 pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the 1994
MY is 131,000 pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds by
the 198993, 5-year national yield of 1,286 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 101.87
acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing
the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 0.08 acre, by the total of the 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.



(5) Cigar-Filler and Binder (Types 4244 and 5355) Tobacco



The yearly average quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco produced in the
United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY
was approximately 16.0 million pounds. The average annual quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244
and 5355) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding
the 1993 MY was less than 100,000 pounds. Domestic use has trended downward and exports are almost nonexistent. Accordingly,
a normal year's domestic consumption has been established at 12.0 million pounds while a normal year's export has
been established at 60,000 pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act
results in a reserve supply level of 34.8 million pounds.

Manufacturers and dealers report stocks of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco held
on October 1, 1993, of 30.8 million pounds. The 1993 cigar-filler and binder crop is estimated to be 7.7 million pounds.
Therefore, the total supply of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco for the 1993 MY
is 38.5 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total about 9.0 million pounds.
By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 29.5 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994
MY is obtained.

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 5.3 million pounds.
This represents the quantity of cigar-filler and binder tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during
such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Slightly less than 70 percent of the announced national marketing
quota may be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a 1994 national marketing quota of 7.75 million pounds
is necessary to make available production of 5.3 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act,
it has been further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid
undue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 9.3 million pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 9.3 million pounds
by the 198993, 5-year national average yield of 1,879 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment
of 4,949.44 acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g), of the 1938 Act, a national factor of 0.70 is determined by dividing the
national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 4 acres, by the total of the 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.



(6) Cigar-Filler (Type 46) Tobacco



There is no demand for cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. Accordingly, the reserve supply level is zero. The estimated
carryover at the start of MY 1994 is 0.6 million pounds.

Because the estimated carryover exceeds the reserve supply level, the quantity of tobacco which may be marketed during
MY 1994 and the 1994 acreage allotment are both zero.



(7) Referendum Results for Fire-Cured (Types 2123) and Dark Air-Cured (Types 3536) Tobaccos



Marketing quotas shall be in effect for the 1994 MY for fire-cured (types 2123) and dark air-cured (types 3536)
tobaccos. In referenda held March 2831, 1994, 89.8 percent of producers of fire-cured (types 2123)
tobacco and 90.0 percent of producers of dark air-cured (types 3536) tobacco voted in favor of marketing quotas.

The following is a summary of the results of the separate referenda:
