FT  11 DEC 92 / Raids on neo-Nazi suspects
HUNDREDS of police in six German states raided the homes and offices of
suspected neo-Nazis yesterday, as the government stepped up its crackdown on
racist violence and right-wing extremism.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, banned a second neo-Nazi
organisation, the German Alternative (DA), and the federal prosecutor
arrested two members of a self-styled militia group, called the 'Werewolf
Hunting Unit'.
The moves came as Chancellor Helmut Kohl led the German parliament in its
strongest and most united condemnation of the rash of racist attacks on
foreigners and asylum-seekers' hostels.
The number of attacks on foreigners has risen from 2,462 last year, to 4,587
recorded so far this year, according to the federal criminal investigation
office.
Mr Kohl said the country was facing a 'terrifying increase in violence', in
which there was no justification for anyone to indulge in violence.
Mr Seiters denounced the DA as a neo-Nazi organisation particularly active
in eastern Germany.
Police immediately launched raids on the homes and offices of an estimated
300 members in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Saxony, in the east, and Hesse,
North Rhine-Westphalia and the Rhineland-Palatinate in west Germany.
The organisation was to contest local elections in east Germany, and
propaganda documents, as well as a motley arsenal of weapons such as a
sawn-off air rifle and a starting pistol, were seized in the raids.
