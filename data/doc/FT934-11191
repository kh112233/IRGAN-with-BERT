FT  02 NOV 93 / People: Crawford moves up at Bull UK
The vacancy at the top of Bull UK and Ireland caused by the elevation of
George McNeil to the presidency of Bull Europe has been filled by Philip
Crawford, formerly managing director of the UK company's services
operations.
Crawford, 41, represents the new face of Bull as the French computer
manufacturer struggles to restore growth and profitability. He is young even
by computer industry standards and says he has 'a lot of energy'.
For the past five and a half years he has been developing Bull's services
business, now seen as a principal plank in the company's strategy. Starting
from virtually nothing, he built it up to a Pounds 30m business this year
out of the UK company's total turnover of about Pounds 200m. He sits on
Bull's worldwide council for services strategy.
Crawford trained as a metallurgist at Sheffield Polytechnic and worked
initially at GKN Contractors in the US where he learned about manufacturing
automation. He moved into the computer industry as a manufacturing
consultant with the then leading software house Management Science America,
now absorbed into Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software.
'Bull', he says drily, 'is not short of challenge', but he speaks warmly of
the freedom the company allows for local managers to make their own
decisions. Whether this is likely to continue under new chairman Jean-Marie
Descarpentries is something he will learn shortly when the two have their
first meeting.
