FT  12 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television
It seems astonishing that it is nearly 19 years since Ronnie Barker first
appeared as Norman Stanley Fletcher, old lag extraordinary, in the splendid
Clement/la Frenais comedy Porridge. Today BBC1 begins a re-run starting with
the pilot, a one-off comedy from a seven-part Barker showcase. Fletch is on
his way to gaol, accompanied by martinet Mackay and softie Barrowclough. One
of the best things about Porridge was that it was not a domestic sitcom.
Nor is Red Dwarf V (9.00 BBC2) which is, of course, set in a spacecraft
manned by one hologram, one robot, a female computer and Craig Charles. For
those addicted to Falklands War programmes who feel in need of a fix BBC2
starts yet another series: War Stories (9.30) which begins with the views of
Nick Barker, who was captain of HMS Endurance.
The bonk rate in The Camomile Lawn goes up considerably and there is even an
instance of what Dr Alex Comfort, MB PhD, calls 'the buttered bun': having
given comfort (small c) to Oliver on the sitting room sofa, Calypso joins
her husband, who is as tired as a newt, on the floor of the front hall for
more jollies (10.00 C4).
