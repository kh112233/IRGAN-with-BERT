FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Beauford capital reconstruction
Beauford, the engineering and ceramics group, said the High Court had
confirmed the reduction of its share premium account by Pounds 4.5m and a
Pounds 3.56m reduction in its share capital to Pounds 6m.
Accordingly, the negative balance on the profit and loss account had been
eliminated and the company would be able to pay dividends on any future
profits.
Beauford cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 26.4m to Pounds 7.43m in 1993.
