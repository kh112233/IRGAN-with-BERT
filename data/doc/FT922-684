FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Prospect makes Pounds 10m purchase
PROSPECT INDUSTRIES, the specialist engineer is paying Pounds 10.1m for
Davenport Holdings, which builds water cooling towers. Hull-based Prospect
also reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 737,000 for the six months to March
31, compared with profits of Pounds 112,000.
Davenport, which is Prospect's fourth acquisition in the past year, had
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds 11m in 1991. Net assets
at March 31 were Pounds 4.5m including net cash of Pounds 2.3m.
The consideration, being paid in three parts, will be satisfied by shares or
a combination of shares and loan notes at the option of Prospect.
Prospect blamed its fall into losses on the seasonality of its Dunn purchase
which was included in the interim results for the first time. However every
subsidiary, apart from Airmatic, the smallest company in the group, showed
improved results.
Group turnover for the six months was Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 5m). Losses per
share were 0.47p (0.11p earnings). The interim dividend has been increased
to 0.25p (0.1p) reflecting directors expectations.
