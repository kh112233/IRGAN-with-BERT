FT  25 MAR 92 / Italy's exodus from large cities
Italy's population has scarcely grown over the past decade and is shifting
from large city centres to smaller cities and large towns, according to
preliminary results of the 10-yearly national census, published yesterday,
writes Robert Graham in Rome. The population grew by just 0.3 per cent to
56,411,290, compared with a 3.9 per cent increase in the previous decade,
confirming Italy's declining birthrate, one of the lowest in Europe.
