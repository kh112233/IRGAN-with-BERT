FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Incentives for UK investors
BRITISH RETAIL investors are being offered some favours in the Wellcome
share sale, although nothing like those now usual in privatisations.
They will have to pay the same price as large investors, buy at least Pounds
1,000 worth and pay in one instalment.
Shareholders on the Wellcome register on June 15 and with addresses in the
UK will be sent blue forms giving them priority if they apply for up to
Pounds 5,000 worth of shares. They can also buy shares in the general offer.
Otherwise, UK investors can apply either on application forms or through
retail selling agents. A number of shares will be reserved for the UK
market, with a limit of Pounds 100,000 per applicant. Shareholders can apply
through a personal equity plan or transfer shares bought in the offer to a
Pep, to take advantage of the tax concessions of Peps.
A share information office opened yesterday. The telephone number is 081 944
1242.
