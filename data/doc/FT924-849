FT  22 DEC 92 / E European countries set up trading zone
POLAND, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic yesterday established a
regional trading zone designed gradually to eliminate tariff barriers by the
end of the century and ensure compatibility with the European Community and
countries of the European Free Trade Area.
Tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods are to be reduced between 1995
and 1997 while barriers to trade in other more sensitive categories such as
cars, textiles and steel are to be scrapped by 2001.
The signing in Krakow yesterday was greeted with relief, given the tension
between Hungary and Slovakia over the Danube dam and the 'divorce' of
Slovaks and Czechs at the beginning of 1993.
At one point, the Hungarians had wanted a bilateral free trade pact with the
Poles. The Czechs stressed their free trade credentials and their
differences with the Slovaks by pressing for a shortening to four years of
the period in which tariffs are to be reduced.
The Slovaks wanted to lengthen the time frame to eight years. In the end,
the agreement which scraps tariffs on raw materials and goods where exports
do not compete directly with locally-produced items on March 31 1993, is
accompanied by a declaration committing the signatories to start new talks
on eliminating tariff barriers within five years.
