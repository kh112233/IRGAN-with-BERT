FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Coming clean on the
environment
Small businesses are under increasing pressure to conform to quality and
environmental standards which have often been devised with larger companies
in mind.
Barclays Bank and Sandwell Training and Enterprise Council have combined to
help five small- and medium-sized companies based in the West Midlands
qualify for BS7750, a new British Standard which sets a framework for the
development of good environmental practices. Companies have been chosen from
'dirty' industries, including steel-making, chemicals and paint.
A further 300 companies are taking part in a BSI assessment of BS7750. They
have been split into 35 working groups covering industry sectors such as
fishing, construction, wood products and hotels and restaurants.
