FT  02 JUL 92 / Collor secures breathing space
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor seems to have rescued himself from the brink of
political obliteration with his impassioned television address to the
Brazilian people late on Tuesday, but his future remains uncertain,
Christina Lamb reports from Braslia.
The immediate threat that the main government party would withdraw its
support has been overcome, but pressure continues from the media and
opposition parties for his resignation, following Mr Collor's strong denial
of an avalanche of corruption charges.
The focus is now on the congressional inquiry into alleged corruption by Mr
Collor's former friend and campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias.
In his speech, Mr Collor denied all links with Mr Farias since he assumed
the presidency, dismissing charges that Mr Farias had paid his expenses, and
accusing his opponents of 'fabricating a crisis'.
However, despite a masterful performance, the president offered weak
evidence, leaving many allegations unanswered.
