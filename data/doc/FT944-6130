FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Singapore group buys Four
Seasons hotel
The Singapore-based hotel group Hotel Properties is to buy the Four Seasons
hotel in Mexico City, for Dollars 37.9m, Reuter reports.
The purchase is through the acquisition of Zopar, a division of Banque
Paribas subsidiary Zofipar. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Immobiliara
Nacional Mexicana, Zopar owns the 243-room hotel which was opened in March

in which HPL will own 80 per cent of the share capital and a private company
the rest.
