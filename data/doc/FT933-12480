FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Solid growth for Schering-Plough
SCHERING-PLOUGH, the US healthcare group, reported second-quarter profits up
18 per cent from Dollars 184m to Dollars 213m. Turnover rose 10 per cent
from Dollars 1.02bn to Dollars 1.12bn. Excluding changes in exchange rates,
sales would have increased 11 per cent.
'Schering-Plough is performing extremely well, even as its US and
international markets daily grow more challenging,' said Mr Robert Luciano,
chief executive and chairman.
'We expect solid growth in 1993 as Claritin continues to gain sales and
market share in the US and as our most significant products progress
internationally,' he added.
The group's pharmaceuticals division reported sales up 12 per cent for the
quarter. International turnover was particularly strong, up 18 per cent,
while domestic sales rose 6 per cent. For the first six months turnover in
the drugs division rose from Dollars 1.63bn to Dollars 1.81bn.
Intron A, a new treatment for hepatitis C, Claritin, a non-sedating
anti-histamine, and Eulexin, a therapy for prostate cancer, all generated
impressive growth, said the company. However, domestic sales of Proventil, a
line of asthma products, fell, primarily because of generic competition.
Turnover at the Wesley-Jessen vision care business fell compared with the
1992 second quarter, due to lower sales of coloured contact lenses and the
sale in May 1992 of its domestic contact lens solutions business.
The healthcare division, which includes over-the-counter products, sun-care
and foot-care products, increased turnover 3 per cent.
Sales of sun-care products increased, but over-the-counter business fell due
to the increasingly competitive environment for anti-fungal products.
For the first half, sales by the healthcare division dropped from Dollars
408m to Dollars 405m.
