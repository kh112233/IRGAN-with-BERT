FT  10 AUG 93 / Italian mamas turn new leaf
The Italian 'mama' - once a byword for big, bouncy, babies - has turned a
new leaf, according to new population projections from the United Nations,
writes Haig Simonian.
The average fertility rate of Italian women is expected to drop to 1.3 per
head in the period 1990-1995, according to the UN's World Population Report.
That puts Italy ahead of the rest of the world in terms of declining family
sizes. Even mothers in other industrialised European countries, such as
Germany, where childbirth has been steadily falling, are still having more
babies than the Italians.
