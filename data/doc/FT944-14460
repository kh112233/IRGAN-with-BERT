FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Survey on financial advice - At a
glance
Only 8 per cent of consumers are willing to pay for financial advice, says a
new survey from market research firm Mintel. Slightly more men than women
feel it worthwhile, and it is older, richer people who are prepared to pay.
In practice a quarter of all people who took financial advice in the 12
months before the survey period asked friends and relations. And a further
21 per cent went to their bank manager, even though none of the clearers
offer independent advice any more. A majority think life assurance is a good
way to save.
