FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Hole in one for golf design
THE golf club industry may not seem to be the most obvious market for
computer-aided design systems, but at Dunlop Slazenger, in Normanton, West
Yorkshire, a Cad system from Silicon Graphics has enabled golf club
designers to design a whole range of high-performance clubs.
The design of a golf club is intricate - change one element of the club and
it is likely to have an unexpected impact on other parts. As a result the
design of clubs has been time-consuming.
With the Synergy range, however, computer technology enabled the company to
develop one club in the range on the screen and then generate the rest in
the set automatically.
The 3D graphics enable the designers to visualise the club and rotate it on
screen, analysing its performance. In particular, it has enabled the company
to move the centre of gravity in the clubs as required, and to accurately
calculate and position the 'cavity back' or hollow which appears in each
club.
