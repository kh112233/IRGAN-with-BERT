FT  27 APR 94 / VW espionage case widens
The discovery of fresh evidence and the investigation of new suspects in the
long-running Volkswagen/General Motors industrial espionage case are
expected to be announced by German state prosecutors today. Mr Volkmar
Kallenbach, spokesman for Darmstadt criminal investigators, said today's
report on the case would deal with 'new findings' and the scope of the
investigation. However, Mr Kallenbach yesterday denied reports that Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production director, would soon face
charges. Furthermore, he would neither confirm nor deny German media reports
that plans for a revolutionary new VW car factory had been found to be
virtually identical to a similar secret project on which Mr Lopez worked
while at GM.
The probe which started last spring into allegations that Mr Lopez and three
former colleagues from the US group took industrial secrets with them when
they abruptly joined VW last March is still far from complete and legal
experts said today's statement was unlikely to contain many details since
the prosecutors had to be careful to avoid prejudice in the event of future
charges and trial.
