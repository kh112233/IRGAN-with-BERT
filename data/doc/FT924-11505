FT  26 OCT 92 / Bank deadline forIndian dam plan
WORLD BANK shareholders have warned the Washington-based organisation that
they will cut off money for the controversial Sardar Sarovar dam and canal
projects on India's Narmada river if new performance benchmarks are not met
by April, writes George Graham in Washington. But the bank's executive
board, representing individual member countries or groups of countries,
voted to continue financing Sardar Sarovar while efforts are made to meet
criticisms of the project's impact on the environment and on more than
200,000 people who will be displaced.
