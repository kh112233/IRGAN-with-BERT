NATION IN BRIEF; 
TEXAS; 
ASBESTOS CONCERNS VALID, PANEL WARNS 
Scientists at a national conference on asbestos said people should be somewhat 
skeptical of new claims that asbestos, used for years in buildings as a fire 
retardant and insulation, is not as dangerous as has been claimed. 
Research in the 1960s found that inhaling the fibrous mineral increases the 
risk of developing lung cancer. Articles published in the past year in some 
medical journals and science magazines played down the risks associated with 
asbestos. But panelists at the National Asbestos Conference in San Antonio said 
the articles should be viewed with caution, that evidence from recent studies 
indicates asbestos exposure does pose health risks and that more studies are 
needed.
