MEXICAN MIGRANT WORKER DIES OF RABIES IN OREGON 
An 18-year-old Mexican migrant worker has died of rabies, a rare type of 
fatality last reported in Oregon a decade ago, authorities said Friday. A state 
health officer said the source of the rabies that killed the man last week was 
not known, but might have been a bat.
