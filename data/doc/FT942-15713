FT  14 APR 94 / Channel rail fare to undercut air price
The operators of train services through the Channel tunnel said yesterday
they plan to undercut airlines' prices for fares from London to Paris and
Brussels.
Unlike the car shuttle service through the tunnel between Folkestone and
Calais, which has been priced at a small premium to competing ferry
services, Eurostar through-trains are to adopt aggressive pricing.
The British, French and Belgian railways had originally considered
undercutting the airlines by up to 25 per cent, but a recent airline price
war will mean there is a smaller discount, a senior official involved in the
project said yesterday.
European Passenger Services, a joint venture of the national railways,
expects to announce details of its fares on May 17, when it hopes to give a
definite starting date for services.
Officially EPS is saying that its fares will be similar to the airlines'.
'We'll offer a business class fare which will be similar to the club fare of
the airlines,' said Mr Malcolm Southgate, deputy managing director. 'Our
leisure fares will be similar, but the conditions will be less restrictive
to achieve a fares advantage.'
He was speaking on the first Eurostar demonstration run to carry passengers
which took place between Paris and Arras.
The Pounds 24m train covered the 112 miles in 50 minutes reaching a top
speed of 186mph.
Eurostar trains have yet to carry passengers through the tunnel. A limited
service is due to start in July increasing to a full service in September or
October. Journey times from London Waterloo will be three hours to Paris and
three hours 15 minutes to Brussels.
The Eurostar trains are based on the French TGV but are lower and narrower
to fit on the UK network. They have been designed to work on three different
power systems and four different signalling systems.
