FT  13 NOV 93 / Chetniks accuse Milosevic
MR Vojislav Seselj, the ultranationalist leader and main rival to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday accused Mr Milosevic of getting rich
from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
Mr Seselj said the Serbian president was behind hard currency swindles and,
with other Belgrade officials, had amassed war booty from Bosnia.
Mr Seselj is an MP and commander of the Chetniks, a paramilitary unit
accused of human rights atrocities.
His remarks coincided with the publication in Serbia for the first time
since the eruption of war two and a half years ago, of eyewitness accounts
of atrocities committed by the Chetniks in Bosnia and Croatia.
The accounts have fuelled speculation that Mr Milosevic, desperate to get UN
sanctions lifted, may be prepared to change his mind and hand war criminals
 -possibly including the Chetniks - to an international war crimes tribunal.
The UN war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia is due to open on November
17 at The Hague.
Mr Seselj, accused Mr Milosevic of wanting to foment a civil war in Serbia
in order to call a state of emergency and cancel the elections.
Vojska, the Yugoslav army magazine, accused the Chetniks of murder and rape.
But diplomats said the charges may be aimed at the domestic arena to
eliminate Mr Seselj's Radicals in the elections. Up to 40 members of his
party have reportedly been arrested in the past two weeks.
