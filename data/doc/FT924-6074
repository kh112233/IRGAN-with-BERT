FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bank Austria to raise Vindobona
stake to 51%
Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, is to raise its stake in
the troubled securities house Vindobona Privatbank from 25 per cent to 51
per cent.
Bank Austria said the performance and image of Vindobona, set up by four
young equity market specialists two years ago, had not lived up to its
expectations.
Earlier this year, Mr Michael Margules, one of its founders, was charged
with money laundering in the US. In August, the Austrian fraud police opened
an investigation into the part played by some Vindobona employees, including
Mr Michael Lielacher, the chief executive, in issues of shares of Hungarian
companies two years ago.
A Bank Austria spokesman said Vindobona's profits this year were likely to
fall 20 per cent below the expected Sch90m (Dollars 8.04m) to Sch100m level.
The plan is that the founding executives, who own 40 per cent of Vindona,
will agree at a shareholders' meeting on December 3 to sell part of their
holdings to Bank Austria, lifting its stake to 51 per cent.
Mr Lielacher confirmed that he would stand down as chief executive, and Bank
Austria said it would be installing its own managers.
