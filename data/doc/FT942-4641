FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: UK
Voting today. Over monetary union, the governing Conservatives say the UK
parliament should have the right to decide on a single currency. Opposition
Labour is more compliant, saying exchange rates should be fixed after
economic convergence. Liberal Democrats support moves to a single currency
'in step' with other states.
On political union, the Conservatives insist the EU cannot supersede
nations, and Britain's veto must be retained on issues of vital national
interest. Labour is committed to an integrated and co-operative Europe, with
veto retained on defence, fiscal, foreign and constitutional matters.
The Liberal Democrats are for a democratic, decentralised, federal Europe.
They support a significant extension of qualified majority voting but with
national veto retained over monetary and defence decisions by the council of
ministers.
The social chapter is opposed by the Conservatives and backed by Labour. The
Liberal Democrats support it on balance, but are opposed to 35-hour week
'straitjacket'.
LIKELY RESULT: Conservatives likely to win less than 30 per cent of vote,
with sharp fall in seats from 32 in 1989 magnified by majority voting
system. Labour could take 50 or more; Liberal Democrats up to 12.
