FT  22 OCT 94 / Papers cleared over price cuts
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of Fair Trading, yesterday rejected
allegations that price cuts at The Times and the Daily Telegraph amounted to
predatory behaviour.
Sir Bryan said an OFT inquiry had not established a case for formal action
under competition legislation.
The cuts had had wide-ranging effects on other newspapers and did not appear
to be targeted at a particular title, the OFT decided.
'In view of the number of competing titles, it does not seem likely that a
predator would be able to recoup any losses out of supra-normal profits in
the future,' Sir Bryan argued.
At News Corporation's annual meeting in Australia earlier this week Mr
Rupert Murdoch made clear he intended to keep the price of The Times low for
the forseeable future to try to dent further the circulation dominance of
The Daily Telegraph.
The paper's average sales between April and September was 549,770, a rise of
46.4 per cent on the same period last year. Apart from a small dip in
August, the paper's sales rose in each of the last six months, reaching
607,143 in September. But the rate of increase may be starting to slow.
The 30p Daily Telegraph appears to be stable at 1.091m and has now been
above 1m for the past four months. The Independent has not made a
significant sales breakthrough and the average circulation for the six-month
period was 276,259, a drop of 17.78 per cent on the same period last year.
Since it cut its cover price to 30p sales have increased by about 30,000. In
August sales were 289,403 while last month they were 290,031.
