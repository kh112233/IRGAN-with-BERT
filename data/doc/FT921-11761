FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Du Pont suffers loss of Dollars
240m in fourth quarter
DU PONT, the biggest US chemicals group, suffered a Dollars 240m loss in the
fourth quarter of 1991 following some Dollars 469.5m of special charges
associated with cost reductions, business restructuring and the recall of a
fungicide product.
The loss, which compares with a Dollars 468m net profit in the last quarter
of 1990, would have been even larger had it not been for a Dollars 391m
extraordinary credit resulting from the sale of assets, including an
interest in its coal business.
The coal business gain, together with other asset disposals, was
insufficient to offset net charges of Dollars 328.6m for the whole of 1991.
Du Pont's net income for 1991 slumped by 39.3 per cent, to Dollars 1.4bn.
When the non-recurring gains and losses are stripped out, Du Pont's 1991
earnings per share of Dollars 2.08, against Dollars 3.40 in 1990, were 43
per cent lower, year-on-year.
Du Pont's total sales fell by 11.7 per cent to Dollars 9.77bn in the fourth
quarter of 1991, and by 3.4 per cent to Dollars 38.7bn for the full year.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said the company's operating results were
affected by sluggish economies worldwide, which caused weak demand and price
pressures for chemicals, polymers and products for the printing and
electronic industries.
On an after-tax basis, all of Du Pont's divisions experienced reduced 1991
operating earnings except for the coal business, which benefited from an
asset disposal.
With extraordinary items stripped out of calculations, the fibres business,
had 28 per cent improved earnings that benefited from higher demand for
apparel fibres and reduced costs. On this basis, earnings from chemicals
were 35 per cent lower, while the polymers division suffered a 42 per cent
drop in income.
Du Pont's diversified business division recorded 60 per cent lower 1991
earnings, reflecting higher costs in agricultural products and lower sales
volumes and margins in most of the electronics and imaging systems
businesses. Petroleum earnings were down 11 per cent in 1991, reflecting
lower crude prices.
Mr Woolard said he believed the company's underlying strengths and benefits
from cost reduction programmes would put Du Pont in a position to gain from
a resumption of growth in world markets.
