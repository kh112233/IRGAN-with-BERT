FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyana to meet sugar quota
AFTER DECLARING shortfalls on its European Community sugar export quota for
the past three years, Guyana expects to meet the 167,000 tonnes quota in
full this year, according to government officials.
The quota, to be delivered by the end of June, will be supplied from a
better-than-expected second harvest last year, which yielded 115,000 tonnes,
and from this year's first harvest.
