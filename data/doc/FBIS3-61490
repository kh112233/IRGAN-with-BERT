  [Abstract] The author points out initially that, although 
some researchers believe that tidal internal gravitational waves 
in the ocean possess a modal structure, others are of the 
opinion that the formation of a field of vertically standing 
internal gravitational waves in such a variable medium as the 
ocean would probably not occur. Using data from soundings 
carried out by a drifting scientific research ship, the author 
attempts to determine the amplitude functions of the individual 
modes of tidal internal gravtitational waves by means of an 
analysis of vertical temperature soundings. 
  Soundings, which were carried out in the region of 910' 
North latitude and 17606' West longitude, were at 30-minute 
intervals and reached a depth of 600 m. For an analysis of the 
profiles of the vertical soundings the method of empirical 
orthogonasl functions was used. 
  The conclusions which could be drawn from the results of the 
soundings were as follows: 
  1. In the part of the ocean which was examined the average 
state of a random field of internal gravitational waves on tidal 
frequency can be represented in the form of a superposition of 
vertically standing internal waves. 
  2. In the open ocean the mechanism for the generation of 
tidal internal waves with a modal structure may be the 
parametric instability which is produced by tide-forming forces.
