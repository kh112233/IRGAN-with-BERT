FT  22 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: German prices rise on interest rate hopes
GERMAN government bond prices rose on hopes of lower interest rates after Mr
Theo Waigel, the finance minister, was quoted in the press saying that a cut
in interest rates would be the most effective single measure to revive the
German economy.
The Liffe bund future contract crept up from 91.77 to a high of 91.97 before
ending the day at around 91.95, but volume was low at about 9,500 contracts.
Two of the German states reported their inflation figures for the month to
mid-December yesterday. The cost of living in Bavaria climbed 0.2 per cent
in the month to mid-December from mid-November, giving a year-on-year rise
of 4.0 per cent. In Baden-Wurttemberg, prices rose 0.2 per cent in the
month, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.5 per cent.
Last week, Hesse announced a 0.2 per cent rise month-on-month, giving a
year-on-year increase of 4.2 per cent.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, French government bonds closed slightly higher as
pressure on the French franc eased slightly in the foreign exchange markets.
The Bank of France left the intervention rate unchanged at 9.10 per cent at
its securities repurchase tender, but kept market conditions tight by
draining FFr2.4bn in liquidity from the system.
The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 opened with a yield of 8.29 per cent and
ended at 8.27 per cent. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March
bond futures contract rose from 111.12 to 111.30 although volume was light
ahead of the Christmas holiday.
US Treasury prices posted solid gains in thin trading yesterday as the
market prepared for the week's note auctions and the end of the year.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 102
3/4 , yielding 7.384 per cent. However, prices at the short end of the
market, were flat, with the two-year note trading unchanged at 100, yielding
4.606 per cent.
The lack of fresh economic news meant that attention was focused on
forthcoming supply. Today, the Treasury will sell Dollars 15.5bn in two-year
notes, and tomorrow another Dollars 11.25bn will be raised from the sale of
five-year notes.
Many of the market's players have closed their books for the end of the
year, so traders are expecting demand for the new paper to be weak, which
could push up rates in the short-term. This expectation, plus some
short-covering by dealers and futures-related buying, helped lift prices at
the long end.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds drifted lower in very thin pre-holiday trade, with the
Liffe gilt future slipping to 99.17 from 99.23.
JAPANESE government bonds closed firmer. They were given a lift by buying
from some of the agricultural institutions, dealers said.
Trading volumes were thin and the yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB ended at
4.6 per cent, having moved in a range of 4.595 per cent to 4.61 per cent.
The March futures contract moved in a range of 107.54 to 107.65, and ended
at 107.59 against its close of 107.58 on Friday. The Bank of Japan said
money supply shrank 0.5 per cent in November from a year earlier. This
compared with a 0.6 per cent fall in October. The figure was in line with
expectations.
