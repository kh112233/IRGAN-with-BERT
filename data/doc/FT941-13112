FT  27 JAN 94 / Unions urge Clinton to intervene at Caterpillar
Two British unions are to ask US President Bill Clinton to urge the
Caterpillar Corporation to restore union rights to the white-collar
workforce at its Leicester production plant.
The US multinational, the world's biggest construction equipment
manufacturer, has offered staff Pounds 500 each and improved benefits in
return for giving up collective bargaining and moving to individual
employment contracts.
Derecognition of the MSF general technical union and Apex, the white-collar
section of the GMB general union, is due to take place on April 26. Last
week the majority of the workers voted in a company-organised ballot to
accept Caterpillar's terms.
Union leaders believe the company intends to make a similar offer to its 600
manual workers, represented by the AEEU electrical and engineering union. If
they accept, all Caterpillar's UK operations will be non-union.
The unions argue that the company has breached article 42 of the
International Labour Organisation code on multinationals, which says unions
should 'enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference in their
functioning or administration'. They also accuse Caterpillar of contravening
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development code of conduct
for multinationals.
The Geneva-based International Metalworkers Federation is also calling on
the Clinton administration to put pressure on Caterpillar.
Mr Clinton joined a United Auto Workers' union picket line outside the
company's Peoria plant in Illinois in 1992.
Mr Owen Bieber, the UAW's president, wrote to Mr Donald Fites, Caterpillar
chairman, last week saying that the company's action in the UK was 'glaring
and damning proof that all over the world your real objective is to bust
unions pure and simple'.
