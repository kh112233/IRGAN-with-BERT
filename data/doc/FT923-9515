FT  05 AUG 92 / House-building starts fall 8%
BUILDERS started work on 8 per cent fewer homes in the three months after
the general election than in the preceding three months, according to
figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment.
These showed that after allowing for seasonal adjustments builders started
work on 38,900 homes in Britain in April, May and June. This compared with
42,200 in the first three months of this year and 39,200 in the
corresponding months last year.
The quarterly figures are the lowest since the final three months of 1990.
Housing starts have flagged in recent weeks as builders have realised that
the market remains deeply depressed in spite of the removal of political
uncertainty following the outcome of the election.
According to the department private housing starts made by builders were 6
per cent lower than in the previous three months and 7.5 per cent lower than
in April, May and June last year.
The only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy outlook for housebuilders is a
sharp rise in work provided by housing associations. The government wants
housing associations to take over the local authorities' role as the main
providers of social housing for rent for needy and disadvantaged people.
Housing associations started work on 7,600 homes in the three months to the
end of April. This was 55 per cent more than in the same period last year.
Local authorities started work on 500,000 homes compared with 1m in April,
May and June last year.
Housing associations have seen grants rise sharply since their role was
enhanced by the 1988 Housing Act. They are also expected to finance an
increasing proportion of building and refurbishment by raising funds from
private investors.
The number of homes built by housing associations is expected to rise from
27,000 to more than 40,000 in the 12 months to March 31 1993, at an
estimated cost of Pounds 8bn. Of this, Pounds 1.5bn is expected to come from
private investors.
