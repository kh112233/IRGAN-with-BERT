FT  03 SEP 93 / Russia and US sign technology pacts
RUSSIA and the US signed wide-ranging agreements on technology yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
President Bill Clinton hailed a Russian agreement to adhere to international
guidelines on exporting missile technology as clearing the way for a new era
of high-technology co-operation. Visiting Russian prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Vice President Al Gore signed an agreement opening the
international commercial space launch market to Russia. The pact spells out
basic rules on subsidies and obligates Russia to charge launch service fees
comparable to western prices. Previously, the market was limited to US,
European and Chinese launch providers.
The two also signed a joint statement spelling out a phased approach to
co-operation on human space flight which is expected to lead to Russian
participation in an international space station.
Also signed by US and Russian officials were joint statements on
environmental monitoring and aeronautics which both sides said would lead to
broad co-operation in those fields.
