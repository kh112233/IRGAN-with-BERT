FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Liberty declines to Pounds 3.66m and chief
divides roles
LIBERTY, the retail and wholesale group, yesterday reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 3.66m in the year to January 30.
However, the recommended final dividend is maintained at 5.35p to give an
unchanged total of 7.2p.
Mr Harry Weblin is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive,
handing on the latter job to Mr Patrick Austen. He will start work on May 1,
coming from BTR where he ran the consumer products business.
Liberty came under pressure last year from a South African investor group,
headed by Mr Brian Myerson, which holds 15.77 per cent of the voting shares.
Mr Weblin said the appointment of a chief executive had taken account of
last year's events, but was mainly because he was 63 and approaching
retirement. Two non-executives were appointed recently.
Mr John Pugh, the finance director, said that since an extraordinary meeting
last summer, at which Mr Myerson called for changes to the board and the
enfranchisement of non-voting shares, he had become a 'constructive
shareholder'.
Mr Myerson said he supported the appointments made. He said the question of
enfranchisement would be raised at the annual meeting next month. Mr Pugh
said that under 30 per cent of Liberty's shares were non-voting. 'Our voting
holders own the company as well as control it.'
Trading conditions had been bleak in 1992, Mr Weblin said, but the outlook
for 1993 was better. Wholesale operations were being affected by recession
in export markets, such as France, and so far in 1993 wholesale sales were
running below last year's levels. Retail sales were ahead, especially in the
London store.
In 1992-93 group sales were slightly lower at Pounds 82.4m (Pounds 84.9m)
mainly because of a 20 per cent drop in converting and wholesaling sales to
Pounds 18.1m.
Trading profits fell 38 per cent to Pounds 3.94m. However, the interest
charge was lower at Pounds 283,000, against Pounds 696,000. A higher tax
rate cut earnings per share by 56 per cent to 9.05p (20.77p), still covering
the dividend.
