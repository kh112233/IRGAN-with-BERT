FT  30 OCT 93 / Plaid in PR bid to lift number of female MPs
HALF THE MPs in a future Welsh parliament must be women, Mr Dafydd Wigley,
the Plaid Cymru president, said yesterday.
The Welsh Nationalist leader said that an incoming Labour government or a
Liberal Democrat/Labour pact should use a voting system based on
proportional representation to ensure 'near parity' between men and women
members.
It is expected that a Welsh parliament would be set up in the first year of
an incoming Labour or Liberal Democrat/Labour government.
Plaid Cymru, debating the issue at its annual conference in Cardiff, is
pressing for a chamber made up of two MPs - one man and one woman - from
each of the 38 constituencies in Wales, plus additional elected members, to
give a total of about 100 members.
In his address to the conference - which earlier this week launched a
campaign to put independence back on the political agenda - Mr Wigley, MP
for Caernarvon, gave his support to proposals for a two-stage drive towards
self-government for Wales.
On the last day of the three-day conference today delegates will debate
calls for a Welsh parliament with law-making and financial powers to take
over responsibility for all functions which are currently undertaken by the
Welsh Office and about 80 quangos - such as the Welsh Development Agency.
The second more controversial step, setting up a fully self-governing Welsh
republican state in Europe, would be put to Welsh voters five years later.
