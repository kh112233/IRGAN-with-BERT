FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canada's top banks overcome loan
problems
CANADA'S two biggest chartered banks have reported much improved results for
the third quarter, despite continuing property and corporate loan problems.
Royal Bank of Canada's net profit for the three months ended July was
CDollars 223m (USDollars 168.9m), or 58 cents a share, double the CDollars
112m, or 26 cents, of the 1992 period.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 720m, or CDollars 1.93, up 24 per cent from
CDollars 580m, or CDollars 1.58. Return on assets was 0.69 per cent against
0.57 per cent and on equity 13.4 per cent against 10.3 per cent.
Although loan losses were higher, the trend in revenues and expenses was
favourable. Results benefited from higher fee income and good results from
the brokerage subsidiary. Loan losses this year will total CDollars 1bn, up
CDollars 180m from April 30.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported net profit of CDollars 190m, or
75 cents a share, in the third quarter, against CDollars 186m, or 75 cents.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 539m, or CDollars 2.24, against a loss of
CDollars 33m, or 68 cents, after a CDollars 1bn special loan loss provision.
Third-quarter net interest income rose 7 per cent and good earnings from
investment banking and heavy home mortgage business helped. The rise in
non-interest expense was held to 4 per cent after including the cost of
entering insurance and trust operations.
Non-performing loans continued to decline and the overall ratio to total
loans was 2.6 per cent at end July, down from 3.1 per cent at the end of
January. The total loan loss provision for fiscal 1993 is being increased by
CDollars 40m to CDollars 920m.
The Canadian brokerage industry, helped by surging stock markets and new
bond and share underwriting business, posted record first-half profits.
The 137 member-firms of the Investment Dealers' Association of Canada,
representing the bulk of the industry, had net profit of CDollars 360m, more
than double the CDollars 169m reported for the first half of 1992. The total
surpassed the previous annual record profit of CDollars 338m set in 1991.
Commissions totalled CDollars 1.07bn, up 55 per cent, and represented 42 per
cent of total gross revenues. Mutual fund (unit trust) commissions now make
up 20 per cent of total commissions.
About CDollars 12bn was raised in new equity in the first half and
underwriting revenues were up 57 per cent to CDollars 580m.
