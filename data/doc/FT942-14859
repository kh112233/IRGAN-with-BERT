FT  19 APR 94 / Netherlands coalition at risk
The Netherlands' ruling coalition of Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour
looks set to lose its majority in parliament in the national elections on
May 3, according to an opinion poll released yesterday. The coalition,
currently led by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, won 103 seats in the 1989
election, but the poll predicts it will muster only 61 seats in the 150-seat
lower house of parliament in May. The CDA has been hit by Mr Lubbers'
impending departure from politics, and its share of the vote is forecast to
plummet to 28 seats from 54 in 1989. Labour is expected to win 33 seats,
down from 49 but better than earlier forecasts of 25 seats. The poll,
conducted by the Nipo polling company, shows that the next coalition would
have to consist of at least three parties to rule effectively.
