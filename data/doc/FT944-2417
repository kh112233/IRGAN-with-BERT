FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Smooth switch in principality - Wales
In Wales, where the principle of unitary authorities is broadly supported,
reorganisation of local government has been less contentious than in
England.
The Local Government (Wales) Bill to create 22 single-tier councils became
law in July. Shadow elections will be held next May to the new authorities,
which replace eight county and 37 district councils.
The new councils will take over in April 1996. Cardiff, which is at present
run by the city council and South Glamorgan County Council, will gain
unitary status.
Transition committees have been set up for each of the 22 councils to
facilitate the mergers. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, announced on
Thursday that to meet the reorganisation costs, councils will receive Pounds
43m. Few redundancies are envisaged among the 150,000 full and part-time
workers employed by local government in Wales.
Labour and Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, unsuccessfully pressed the
case for an elected Welsh assembly as a strategic overlord for the new
structure and a counterweight to the powers of the Welsh secretary and
quangos. But detailed opposition to the bill mostly concerned boundaries and
the proposal by Mr Redwood to allow area committees, with some delegated
powers, in geographically large areas such as Powys. Opponents regard these
as likely to create confusion.
The shadow authorities have to produce service delivery plans by next autumn
and Mr Redwood retains powers to order joint arrangements between
neighbouring councils if he believes that necessary.
Unlike in England, no commission set out to canvass local views. Instead,
there was a white paper which originally proposed 21 councils.
