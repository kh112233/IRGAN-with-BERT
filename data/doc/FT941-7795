FT  23 FEB 94 / Observer: Convertible?
Will he, won't he? Now that the Church of England has swept away the last
barrier to women priests, what's to stop environment secretary John Gummer
becoming the first cabinet minister to convert to the Catholic faith?
Gummer, son of an Anglican clergyman, has been teetering on the brink for
ages. He resigned from the Synod last year because of his opposition to
female priests, and read the lesson at the first Catholic communion of Ann
Widdecombe, a junior minister at the Department of Employment.
If Gummer follows Widdecombe, the Duchess of Kent et al on the path to Rome
 -and the smart money is that he will - it will mean that the prime minister
will have one fewer experts to turn to the next time he has to vet a new
clutch of bishops.
Apart from that, the defection would hardly rock the government.
