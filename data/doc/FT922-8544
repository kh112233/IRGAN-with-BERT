FT  13 MAY 92 / Injury risk higher in company cars
COMPANY-OWNED cars are about 30 per cent more likely to be involved in
accidents that cause death or injury than similar cars owned privately,
according to a Department of Transport report published yesterday.
This is partly explained by the higher annual mileages of company cars, says
the report. It also shows that high-performance cars are twice as likely to
be involved in fatal accidents as 'ordinary' versions of the same cars.
This supports the tough line being taken by insurance companies against
'hot' hatchbacks and similar vehicles. Premiums for such cars have risen
sharply under a revised pricing structure introduced by the Association of
British Insurers. However, the increases reflect much higher theft rates as
well as accidents.
A breakdown of all accidents in 1990 showed the BMW 3 series, Volkswagen
Golf GTi, Astra GTE and Ford Escort XR3i among those more likely to be in
serious crashes. Pre-1988 models were the worst, with 63 fatal or serious
accidents per 10,000 vehicles.
Among small cars, the risk of driver injury in an accident was highest for
the Rover Mini and lowest for an early version of the Nissan Cherry; in the
small/medium sector highest-risk cars were the 'old' Ford Escort, Triumph
Acclaim and Vauxhall Chevette, with VW Golfs the lowest risk. In the
medium-car sector, those most at risk were Ford Sierra Sapphire and Cortina
drivers, and least at risk were Renault 21 drivers. The highest risk in the
larger-car sector was the Saab 900, and lowest the Rover 800.
Among the main company cars surveyed, Ford's Sierra hatchback had the
highest injury risk and the Vauxhall Cavalier the lowest.
