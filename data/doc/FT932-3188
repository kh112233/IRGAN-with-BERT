FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses feature mixture
of performances
BOURSES produced a varied performance yesterday, especially where the
peripheral markets were concerned, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN got little support from Friday's after hours discount rate cut, as
attention remained firmly fixed on Ferruzzi and Montedison. Rumours over the
weekend suggesting that two candidates had turned down invitations to head
the group's restructuring programme added to the general mood of despondency
as the Comit index ended 4.45 lower at 527.44.
Montedison was suspendedyesterday after a fall of 14 per cent to L840.
Attempts to fix the prices were later aborted as unofficial trading saw the
stock quoted as low as L750. Ferruzzi sank another L73, or 10 per cent to
L659.
The banking sector was another loser on an initially negative reaction to
the repeal of legislation preventing banks from taking stakes in industry.
This had been long expected as part of the government's privatisation
process, but commentators noted that it had come at a bad time: there were
worries, they said, that banks might be forced into taking stakes in
companies to which they were already exposed, rather than making new
investments.
As a result two of the banks on the list for early privatisation saw sharp
falls: Credito Italiano by L158 to L2,535 and BCA by L204 to L5,038.
PARIS had already discounted a 25 basis point repo rate cut towards the end
of last week, so reaction to yesterday's event was muted. The CAC-40 index
advanced to a day's high of 1,928, before drifting back to close 3.59 lower
at 1,916.84. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.2bn.
Expectations that a joint venture between Matra Hachette and Cap-Gemini
Sogeti would land a US airforce order saw their respective shares gain
FFr3.50 and FFr3.00 to FFr123.50 and FFr190.70.
Peugeot, which announced plans to raise up to FFr2bn on the bond market,
advanced FFr6 to FFr527.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 1.3 to 108.4. Lehman Brothers forecast
that interest rates in the Netherlands, now the lowest in Europe, 'will
remain below those in Germany for the foreseeable future'.
Hoogovens continued to improve following last week's gains, yesterday
putting on Fl 1.60 to Fl 33.70 while another cyclical, DSM, rose Fl1.60 to
Fl 86.20.
Interest in cyclical stocks has developed following a Goldman Sachs note in
which Mr Philip van den Berg forecasts that they will outperform the market
by 5-10 per cent over the next 12 months, estimating that cyclicals are
presently undervalued by about 30 per cent.
FRANKFURT continued to pursue its technical rally, the DAX index closing
11.00 higher at 1,691.98.
Turnover rose from DM5.8bn to DM5.9bn. There were sizeable individual gains
in Siemens, DM8.80 better at DM627.30 as dealers said that the electricals
giant had lagged behind the market recently, and in Lufthansa, up DM4.40 at
DM107.90.
But as on Friday, the outstanding sector gain came in carmakers. BMW rose
DM10.50 to DM483.50 and Daimler by DM10 to DM597.50.
Ms Deborah Boys, technical analyst at James Capel in London, said that
between two and three weeks ago the sector was approaching the historic lows
it had seen in 1988, 1991 and 1992. 'If it had broken below previous lows,'
she said, 'we would have been looking at a major downgrading involving a
large sector of the market, and investors were not prepared to accept this.'
ZURICH continued its consolidation, the SMI index dropping 14.1 to 2,294.2.
Chemicals saw profit-taking, with Sandoz certificates, down SFr60 at
SFr3,170.
BRUSSELS rose on hopes of a Bundesbank interest rate cut this Thursday, the
Bel-20 index ending 10.89 higher at 1,224.44 in volume of 809m shares.
The video screen producer, Barco, rose BFr95, or 6.3 per cent to BFr1,595.
However, the interest rate sensitive majors also moved well, Electrabel
rising BFr90 to BFr5,880 in a strong utilities section and, in banks,
Generale de Banque putting on BFr140 to BFr7,800.
VIENNA extended last week's pickup with a gain of 1.5 per cent, the ATX
index closing 12.46 higher at 850.19. The market was led up by Verbund,
Austria's national electricity supplier, which leapt by Sch40, or 7.3 per
cent to Sch590 on aggressive buying by a foreign investor.
WARSAW went limit up instead of limit down, excess demand forcing the bourse
to suspend trade in 11 stocks as the WIG index jumped 253, or 9.6 per cent
to 2,890.8. Because of the suspensions, turnover was the lowest in three
months at about 42bn zloty.
ISTANBUL responded to the appointment of Mrs Tansu Ciller as prime minister
with a 10.5 per cent gain in the market index, up 925.16 to 9,760.67.
Ms Nur Pekin of Schroders in London said that the market was enthusiastic
about the appointment since Mrs Ciller had been responsible for legislation
earlier this year which had encouraged equity investment, and had led to a
rise in the market index of some 136 per cent since the start of the year.
