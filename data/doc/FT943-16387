FT  05 JUL 94 / Exporters upbeat on long term
British exporters are more confident about their prospects in the long term
than in the short term, says the latest DHL Quarterly Export Indicator.
The balance of responses from 501 directors of manufacturing companies whose
export expectations for the next three months are excellent or good, minus
those whose expectations are fair or poor, was 28 per cent, down from 42 per
cent in the previous quarter.
The balance of expectations for the next 12 months is 61 per cent, up from
59 per cent last time and the highest for 2 1/2 years.
