NATION IN BRIEF; 
AMERICAN SAMOA; 
CYCLONE OFA LASHES ISLANDS; NONE KILLED 
Cyclone Ofa -- the South Pacific equivalent of a hurricane -- lashed American 
Samoa with winds up to 110 m.p.h., causing widespread damage and injuring 
several people but causing no deaths. There were no immediate reports from the 
nearby independent nation of Western Samoa, where the eye of the cyclone passed 
50 miles west of the island of Savii. American Samoa, a seven-island U.S. 
territory east of New Guinea, reported heavy damage to buildings, power and 
water off and roads clogged.
