IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
TWIN QUASARS' BIRTH REPORTED 
An international team of astronomers last week reported that it may have 
witnessed the birth of a pair of quasars. Dr. Georges Meylan of NASA's Space 
Telescope Institute said his team has detected an object in the constellation 
Pisces that appears to be a pair of quasars separated by less than 100,000 
light years -- a small distance in cosmic terms. One light year equals about 6 
trillion miles. 
Quasi-stellar objects, or quasars, are thought to be the very bright cores of 
certain galaxies, and some astronomers believe that their intense energy may be 
caused by their material being pulled inward to giant black holes. 
The international team, which also includes scientists from Caltech in Pasadena 
and from West Germany, said it has discovered what it believes to be the first 
true set of quasar "twins" using a 40-inch telescope near Le Serena, Chile. 
In findings presented at the American Astronomical Society's national meeting 
in Alexandria, Va., the researchers said the quasar twins lie so close together 
in space that astronomers speculate their gravity fields may be interacting 
with one another and spurring formation of the intensely bright objects.
