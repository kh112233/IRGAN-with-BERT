FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Total of overseas voters falls 10%
THE number of overseas electors has fallen by more than 10 per cent since
last year in spite of a Pounds 750,000 government campaign encouraging
Britons abroad to vote.
Labour said the figures, down from 34,454 to 30,899, were a failure for the
Conservatives, the main beneficiaries of the overseas vote. About 2.5m
Britons living overseas are eligible to vote.
Labour said: 'The Conservatives spent Pounds 750,000 of public money and
Pounds 60,000 of their own pursuing overseas voters and the result is still
a drop in the number registering.'
The Conservative party denied that the fall represented a failure, saying
that the government advertising campaign was to publicise changes in the law
which allowed more Britons abroad to register.
Mr David Smith, director of Conservatives Abroad, which was set up to
recruit financial and electoral support among overseas electors, said: 'We
think 70 to 80 per cent of those who have registered will vote for us.'
