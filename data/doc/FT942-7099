FT  27 MAY 94 / Estonia in banking advance
Estonia has become the first of the former Soviet states to introduce
electronic banking. Economic reform throughout the region has been hobbled
by its antiquated banking system. Transactions can take more than three
months, forcing many businesses and individuals to resort to cash and barter
deals. Estonia, which in 1991 launched the most radical market reform
programme in the region, has now entered the electronic banking era. Four
automatic teller machines operating 24 hours a day were opened last week and
tens of thousands of citizens have been invited to apply for credit cards
which are already accepted by more than 250 Estonian merchants. Credit cards
are commonplace among the Soviet Union's lavishly wealthy but tiny elite.
However, Estonia is the first former Soviet republic to bring credit cards
and cash machines to the masses.
