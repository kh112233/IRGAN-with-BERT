BOY, 5, WHO DRANK BOURBON 'LIKE A MAN' DIES IN TEXAS 
A 5-year-old boy who drank 10 ounces of bourbon after an adult allegedly 
prompted him to drink it "like a man" died this morning after his removal from 
life support systems, authorities said. 
Thomas Griffin died at Cook-Ft. 
Worth Children's Medical Center about 8:45 a.m. The respirator supporting the 
youngster's breathing was disconnected Tuesday night, but the child had 
continued to breathe on his own. 
Police said the boy was given the alcohol at a party Friday night and "told to 
drink it like a man." 
Anthony Jimerson, 21, was being held in Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $100,000 
bail after being charged with injury to a child. 
The boy was taken to the hospital Saturday afternoon after he went into 
convulsions. At one point, the boy's blood-alcohol level was about .55%. 
Doctors said he would probably have suffered irreversible brain damage. 
At the time the boy drank the liquor, Jimerson was visiting the apartment of 
Thomas' mother, Patricia Griffin, 31.
