FT  11 APR 94 / Nottingham paper offered for sale
The Nottingham Evening Post and its sister magazine, the weekly Longeaton
Advertiser, are up for sale.
A spokesman for T. Bailey Forman, which owns the family-controlled titles,
said the shareholders were 'evaluating some recent offers'.
If none of the offers were considered 'exceptional' the titles would remain
in the ownership of the current shareholders.
Staff at the Post yesterday said they had been given no more details.
The newspaper has been owned since the end of the last century by the Forman
Hardy family which also has local brewing, farming and property interests.
Mr Nicholas Forman Hardy took charge of the business four years ago.
In 1976 the Post became the first UK newspaper to be produced by journalists
using direct inputting on computers. Other papers quickly followed.
