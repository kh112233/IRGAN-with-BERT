FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Saturn expects GM will fund new
model
Saturn, an experimental car company set up by General Motors to compete more
effectively with Japanese carmakers, said yesterday it expected funding from
GM for a new model in the 1996-97 period, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Saturn makes a single model, distributed through a dedicated retailer
network.
The subsidiary, which began manufacturing in 1990, earned a small profit in
1993 after taxes but before interest payments on Dollars 1.9bn of debt, Mr
Thomas Manoff, vice-president for finance, said yesterday at the Detroit
Auto Show. It is Saturn's first annual profit.
