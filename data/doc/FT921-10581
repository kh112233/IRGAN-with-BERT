FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Both sides to appeal in RSI test case
BOTH SIDES of a legal test case over repetitive strain injury (RSI)
involving former BT keyboard operators are appealing, it emerged yesterday.
The NCU telecommunications workers' union said it was to appeal against some
aspects of the judgment, issued in December. BT announced last month that it
had lodged an appeal against the order to pay damages to the operators.
The case is being watched closely by employers, unions and RSI sufferers.
Previous cases have been settled out of court. The painful and sometimes
debilitating condition which affects arms and hands has mainly affected
blue-collar employees in the past but is being linked increasingly to
keyboard work.
BT has taken the unusual step of giving financial help to the NCU so that it
can defend the appeal. BT said that was in recognition of the case's wider
importance and the 'hefty' costs involved.
The former operators were awarded Pounds 6,000 damages each for pain and
suffering. Loss of earnings have yet to be calculated. The county court in
the City of London ruled that BT had failed to provide adequate desks and
chairs for the operators and had failed to ensure correct posture.
The NCU's appeal concerns the court's judgment on working practices. The
court found that the way operators were paid and monitored and the long
hours worked had contributed to RSI. It ruled, however, that BT could not
have been expected to have known about the risks during the early 1980s,
when the injuries were sustained. The union is contesting the finding.
