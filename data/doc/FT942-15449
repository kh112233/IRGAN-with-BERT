FT  15 APR 94 / Auditors ethical standard proposed
A new ethical framework governing chartered accountants' objectivity and
independence was proposed yesterday by the profession's Joint Ethics
Committee.
The committee is suggesting an 'analytical approach' to replace the
piecemeal standards now dictating ethical standards.
Mr Brian Currie, chairman of the committee, said that maintaining
objectivity was the most important factor rather than 'independence', which
is easily misinterpreted.
His recommendations are that in considering taking on work, accountants
should consider the expectations of those directly affected; the public
interest; the environment in which the work is conducted; the threats of
objectivity; and the safeguards to offset any threats.
It highlights five types of threats to objectivity:
Self-interest: such as from a financial share or interest in the client or a
desire for additional work, or fear of losing a client;
Self-review: such as when examining the auditors' own judgment in previous
years which in hindsight appear incorrect or inappropriate;
Advocacy: in litigation or other adversarial proceedings;
Familiarity or trust: when the auditor may be over -influenced by the
client's personality and qualities and too sympathetic to their interests;
Intimidation: by a dominating personality or other actual or feared
pressures.
