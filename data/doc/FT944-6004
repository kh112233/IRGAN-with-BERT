FT  01 DEC 94 / Ofwat director-general urges costs reduction
Water companies should focus on reducing their costs once they have invested
to meet their obligations, according to Mr Ian Byatt, the director-general
of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, David Lascelles writes.
Following the completion of last summer's price review, Mr Byatt said he
would be switching his attention to several issues of public interest. These
include levels of charges for different water and sewerage services,
comparative efficiency between water companies, and an emphasis on
achievement rather than expenditure.
He said: 'Significant changes have already taken place, notably in relation
to the balance between charges for measured and unmeasured supply. But more
remains to be done.'
At the next price review, he said, the regulator should take account of
whether companies have pursued charging policies which have sufficiently
controlled the resource costs of meeting the demand for water.
