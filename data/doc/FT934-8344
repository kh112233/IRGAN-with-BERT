FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph advances to Pounds 38.7m
THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group said it had seen little sign of recovery from
recession and promised to match price-cutting by competitors with even more
active promotion of its daily and Sunday titles.
The group's pre-tax profit increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 38.7m in the
nine months to September 30, excluding the Pounds 6.5m profit on the
investment in Trinity International Holdings. Turnover increased by 7 per
cent to Pounds 188.3m.
Circulation, which accounted for 47 per cent of total newspaper revenue, had
held up well 'in spite of severe price cutting elsewhere in the market.'
In September, News Corporation cut the weekday cover price of The Times from
45p to 30p. The Daily Telegraph's weekday price remains 48p.
The Daily Telegraph sold 1.01m copies a day in September, down from 1.05m
copies last year. The Sunday Telegraph's circulation edged ahead from
590,000 to 591,000.
The figures suggested that its strategy of increased promotion and the offer
of enhanced reader value would 'maintain the position of The Telegraph's
titles in the quality newspaper market.'
Advertising revenue was 6 per cent ahead, with improvements in display
advertising and, more recently, financial advertising. The classified
recruitment market was flat.
The share of associates' profits rose from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 8.2m,
mainly reflecting an improvement at John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian
publisher in which The Telegraph's interest rose from 15 to 20 per cent.
Yesterday the Telegraph said it had exercised all its outstanding options to
acquire shares or non-voting convertible debentures in John Fairfax. By the
end of the year, the Telegraph expects to hold 25 per cent of the company.
Third quarter profits from Southam, the Canadian newspaper group in which
the Telegraph has a 9.36 per cent stake, 'continue to move in the right
direction,' the group said. It does not expect to see a sizeable return on
its Pounds 67m investment this year, but 'we are confident that Southam
offers potential for 1994 and beyond.'
Earnings per share were ahead from 15.7p to 19.3p.
