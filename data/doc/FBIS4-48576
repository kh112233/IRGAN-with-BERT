  [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- Government troops and 
rebels fought throughout the night with heavy weapons around a 
gendarmerie base in Kigali and the camp of the Presidential 
Guard, but the guns fell silent just before 9:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) 
Monday [23 May], UN spokesman Abdul Kabia reported from the 
Rwandan capital. 
  That was shortly after a ceasefire had been due to come into 
effect at 8:00 a.m. 
  Journalists who visited the site meanwhile said they saw the 
bodies of 15 soldiers of the mainly Hutu government army and 25 
civilians killed during a four-day battle for Kigali airport and 
an adjoining government army base which the mainly Tutsi troops 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front overran Sunday. 
  The warring parties agreed to a two-day ceasefire during the 
visit of Iqbal Riza, a special envoy of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who is due to discuss increasing the UN 
troop strength in the small central African nation from 400 to 
5,500. 
  He was due to arrive later Monday by road from Uganda.
