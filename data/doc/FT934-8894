FT  12 NOV 93 / Czech inflation near 20%
CZECH consumer prices rose by 1.1 per cent in October bringing the
year-on-year inflation rate to 19.9 per cent since October 1992, the Czech
Statistical Office reported yesterday, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna. The
strongest increases were recorded for communications and food products.
Analysts expect inflation for the whole of 1993 to overshoot the
government's 15-17 per cent target.
