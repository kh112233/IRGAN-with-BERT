FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia's tin employers may
disband association
The Malayan Mining Employers' Association (MMEA), which groups Malaysia's
main tin mining and smelting companies, is considering disbanding because of
the dramatic decline in the country's tin industry.
The association says that though there has been a recent rise in tin prices
a sustained recovery has still not been achieved. Last week tin was trading
at around MDollars 14.25 (Dollars 5.36) a kilogram on the Kuala Lumpur
market. Malaysian tin producers say they need prices in the range of
MDollars 16 to MDollars 18 to cover costs.
Last September the Kuala Lumpur price dropped to a low of MDollars 10.78 a
kilogram.
Malaysia was once the world's largest tin producer with an annual output in
the 1960s of between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes; last year its production fell
by 28 per cent to 10,384 tonnes. In 1980 nearly 40,000 workers were employed
in the country's tin industry; according to the MMEA tin employment has
fallen to less than 2,300.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries, which groups many of the world's
big producers, is meeting in Kuala Lumpur this week to review the state of
the world industry. The MMEA is not optimistic about the short term
prospects. It says that other materials like glass, aluminium and plastic
are increasingly replacing tin in the packaging industry.
The MMEA says that the US Defence Logistics Agency has continued to dispose
of large amounts of tin on the world market. Oversupply problems have been
exacerbated, meanwhile, by increased production from relatively new
producers such as Peru, Portugal and Vietnam.
