  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], has said he expects the U.S. Embassy to 
publish a report on the death of Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon 
Rivera, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. [Words indistinct] 
his police organization already issued an initial report on the 
incident based on results of an autopsy conducted on the body of 
the U.S. soldier. 
  [Begin Monterrey recording] U.S. investigators are here to 
collect as much information as possible. We will now wait 
because we already issued our report. The decision of what to 
do is now in their hands. [end recording] 
  Last Wednesday Robert Adams, chief of investigations of the 
Southern Command, which is headquarted in Panama, [words 
indistinct] commentaries on the incident after requesting the 
respective analyses from the Legal Medicine Institute. Julio 
Ramon Rivera died early last Sunday after he detonated a 
fragmentation grenade while under the influence of drugs. The 
explosion seriously injured three PNC agents. They should be 
compensated because they will not be able to work normally, 
Monterrey pointed out: 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey, in progress] ...collaborators 
of justice. We can only do so much, but we cannot go beyond our 
limits. The justice system [words indistinct] or the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] Yes, we talked yesterday with our Legal 
Department. I requested an appointment with the ambassador on 
Friday to talk about that. I think this will move ahead. 
Yesterday, a U.S. Embassy official afternoon [words indistinct] 
with me. We think that this is on the right track. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Maria Monterrey rejected claims from Rivera's relatives 
who said the U.S. soldier had not consumed drugs, as confirmed 
by the director of the Legal Medicine Institute, who based his 
opinion on an autopsy conducted by Salvadoran forensic surgeons.
