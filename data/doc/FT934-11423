FT  01 NOV 93 / Peace given a small chance
TRAFALGAR Square in London yesterday witnessed a Northern Ireland peace
demonstration claimed by its organisers to be the first such event
sanctioned in the square by the Home Office for 25 years.
Mr Liam Cleere, organiser, said: 'If Israel and the Palestinians can settle
their differences; if South Africa can do it; if the Berlin Wall can come
down - then Northern Ireland can be sorted out as well.'
Mr Cleere, an Irish bricklayer living in Kilburn, north London, set up the
Rally for Peace Movement after the Warrington bomb blast which killed two
children in March. He claimed yesterday that the non-political,
non-sectarian movement had 5,000 members, almost all of them Irish people
living in Britain appalled by the violence in Ulster.
Yesterday's protest over the latest week of violence was no mass rally - the
Home Office gave permission only for Mr Cleere and five colleagues to hold
banners in the square.
The pro-Republican Irish Freedom Movement staged a demonstration a few yards
from the peace protesters demanding 'Irish freedom'. Troops Out
demonstrators used similar tactics to disrupt the movement's first rally for
peace, attended by 2,000, in Hyde Park about a month after the Warrington
bombing.
Yesterday Mr Cleere called for Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries to be
'man enough' to lay down their weapons and give the latest formal and
informal peace initiatives a chance to work.
