FT  14 APR 94 / Elusive viruses take costly toll
Viruses are the single most frequent cause of computer breakdown, according
to yesterday's report.
More than one third of respondents reported one or more virus incidents
during the past two years, a large increase on the 16 per cent reported in a
similar survey two years ago.
One case study, of a retail company with 10,000 employees, highlights the
danger even for those with elaborate checking procedures.
At the time of the incident, virus-checking software was installed on each
PC in the company's computer centre and head office, but checking was at the
discretion of the user.
To make the system foolproof, the company decided to buy disk authorisation
software. A virus was detected at the computer centre during trials of the
software. It was eradicated but kept reappearing.
Only at the fourth outbreak, two months after the first, was the virus
traced to an incoming disk from a leading software supplier. The disk
contained updates to bespoke software being produced for the company.
Further checks showed that the virus was present in the software supplier's
own development centre.
In the end, teams had to check more than 2,000 disks; a scanner was hired
for a week and 20 disks were found to be infected.
The up-front cost was Pounds 10,000 for the 70 working days it took to
investigate. But That did not take into account the disruption and
considerable ill-feeling among the staff - including accusations as to who
was the culprit.
The moral: you can't be too careful in checking for viruses.
