FT  22 OCT 94 / Newcastle starts schools campaign
A Pounds 1.5m campaign to raise educational standards in the West End of
Newcastle was launched yesterday.
Newcastle City Challenge, part of the government-backed scheme to regenerate
problem urban areas, says it is the first such project in the country. More
than a third of children in the targeted area enter secondary school at 11
with a reading age below that of an average eight year old.
Some of the money will be spent on extra teachers and on four education
access centres to help parents become actively involved in their children's
education.
