FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Provisional liquidators at GFA offshoots
Trinity Insurance and Bryanston Insurance, the subsidiaries of GFA
International which are under scrutiny for a series of transactions with
companies connected to Mr Rupert Murdoch, yesterday appointed Mr Colin Bird
and Mr Richard Boys-Stones, two partners in Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, as provisional liquidators.
The companies are expected to appeal to the High Court to adjourn existing
compulsory winding-up orders, and also to petition for a scheme of
arrangement in mid-May following an examination of the businesses and
consultation with the creditors.
It is understood that about 120 staff will be made redundant 'shortly'.
