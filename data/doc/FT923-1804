FT  21 SEP 92 / France votes Yes, but only just: Decision a relief to EC
partners
FRANCE yesterday approved the Maastricht treaty on European union by a
wafer-thin margin - to the universal relief of its European Community
partners.
Britain, the current EC president, immediately responded by calling a
special summit meeting of heads of government early next month to consider
how to proceed with ratification of the treaty.
In Washington, Community finance ministers expressed the hope that the vote
would ease tensions within the European Monetary System, while on the
foreign exchanges, the French franc strengthened against the D-Mark.
Early today with all votes counted in metropolitan France and in some
overseas territories 50.95 per cent had said Yes and 49.05 per cent No to
the controversial treaty on an unusually high turn-out of 70.5 per cent. Not
included were votes in overseas possessions west of France where voting
began and ended several hours later.
'We have just lived through one of the most important days for the history
of our country,' said President Francois Mitterrand, in an attempt to soothe
the intense divisions opened by the campaign. The result was a 'yes for
France, a yes for Europe' but there would be neither 'victors nor
vanquished' from the poll, he said.
The vote was the climax of a campaign which exposed deep divisions over
Europe in France, hitherto one of the main driving forces of European
integration, and which at times appeared likely to deal a severe setback to
the European Community. Uncertainty over the outcome also helped fuel the
turbulence on the currency markets in recent weeks, which forced the pound
and the lira to be suspended from the EMS.
The result does not, however, mean that ratification of the Maastricht
treaty - which provides for political, economic and monetary union between
the 12 EC member states, and the establishment of a common currency by 1999
at the latest - is yet assured by the Community's self-imposed deadline of
January 1 1993.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany last night led a chorus of relief among
European Community leaders over the referendum result. He vowed to press
ahead rapidly with efforts to secure ratification of the treaty in his
country and elsewhere, and to work for enlargement of the Community. 'The
positive result of the French referendum, even if it was narrow, will give
the European integration process a new boost in the other member states,' he
said in a statement.
However, approval of the French referendum result among EC governments was
tinged with concern at the narrowness of the outcome and apprehension about
the prospects for ratification of the treaty elsewhere in the Community,
notably in Britain.
Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, congratulated Mr Mitterrand on his
narrow victory. But he said European leaders now had to consider how to
proceed with ratification of the treaty. The summit he had called for early
October would need to consider the recent turmoil in the exchange rate
mechanism of the EMS. Referring to the narrowness of the French vote he
added: 'I think we do have to take into account in public debate the many
concerns that have been raised throughout the Community over recent weeks.'
EC foreign ministers are to meet today in New York, where they are attending
the UN General Assembly, to take stock of the French referendum result.
Their task in seeking to regain the political initiative after the currency
crisis of the last few weeks will inevitably be complicated by the
narrowness of the French verdict, which will do nothing to extinguish the
opposition to Maastricht in Germany, Britain and some other EC member
states.
Mr Kohl still has to secure ratification from both chambers of the German
parliament, while Mr Major is delaying putting the treaty to the Commons
until the problems stemming from Denmark's rejection of the treaty in a
referendum in June are resolved.
It remains unclear how the EC will deal with this difficulty - though Mr
Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, said last night that Danish voters
would be asked to vote on the treaty for a second time next year, with the
addition of special reservations to meet objections to some parts. He said
the narrow vote in France should make it easier for Denmark to negotiate a
special deal with the other member states.
Yesterday's result marks a reprieve for President Mitterrand, who has spent
much of his 12-year presidency working for European integration and who had
staked almost his entire political prestige on securing a Yes vote.
In Paris, the vote was immediately hailed by Mr Laurent Fabius, first
secretary of the ruling Socialist party, as 'a victory for democracy and for
the president who, in calling the referendum, had taken the initiative for
it'.
Mr Paul Quiles, the French interior minister, argued that Mr Mitterrand's
decision to call a referendum had been vindicated. It showed that the French
had 'rejected the demagogy of extremes in refusing to follow those who
worked on their fears and fantasies'.
However, others in both Yes and No camps cautioned that the narrowness of
the majority meant there was no reason to celebrate. It 'gives us a measure
of the work which will be needed, from tomorrow morning, to relieve the
difficulties of the French who have said No,' said Mr Michel Rocard, former
prime minister and a leading supporter of the treaty.
Sensitive to the warning implicit in the closeness of last night's result,
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said: 'Our duty is
to take account of it as much at the national as at the European level. We
will do so by deepening our democratic practices.'
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the leading anti-Maastricht standard-bearer in
the Socialist party, said the result was 'an amber light, not a green one'
for the treaty to go ahead. A re-negotiation was inevitable because 'one
cannot go on as if nothing had happened', he said.
European leaders would now have to take account of the sizeable French No
vote as well as the majority Danish rejection of Maastricht in June.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the opposition RPR who had campaigned for
Maastricht against much rank-and-file opposition in his party, welcomed the
result, but called on his party members to 'find their place again' within
his neo-Gaullist grouping. He urged them to relaunch the offensive against
the government and prepare for a Socialist election defeat.
According to one exit poll, more than 60 per cent of RPR supporters voted
against Maastricht, while more than 60 per cent of the centre-right UDF
voted in favour. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, UDF president, claimed that
his party had 'accounted for a large part of the narrow margin (of
victory)'.
But Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front, said
that taking account of abstentions, 'only one French citizen in three has
actually voted for Maastricht'.
The poll indicated deep splits along class and regional lines, underlining
the domestic challenges now facing the government. A 60 per cent majority of
farmers and industrial workers voted against the treaty, while the
Maastricht plan received 68 per cent support from executives and
professionals, according to exit surveys. Of those who voted against the
treaty, 58 per cent cited fear of loss of national sovereignty and 41 per
cent fear of Germany, said exit surveys.
Any reprieve for Mr Mitterrand from his political problems is likely to
prove temporary. He admitted before the result yesterday that he knew he had
taken a 'considerable' risk in putting Maastricht to a popular referendum.
'But,' he added 'there are times when it is necessary to consult the
people.'
The president took his gamble in putting the treaty to a referendum after it
failed the Danish plebiscite.
