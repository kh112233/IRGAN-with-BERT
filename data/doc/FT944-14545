FT  22 OCT 94 / Nationwide puts strain on Link
Holders of instant access savings accounts with Nationwide Building Society,
the UK's second largest, will have to pay from next month to use cash
machines other than those run by the society itself.
The move to levy a 60p charge per transaction on these customers imposes a
fresh strain on the co-operative basis of the Link network.
It looks set to lead to the imposition of other charges. Halifax Building
Society, the UK's largest, already charges customers 60p for each
transaction carried out on a non-Halifax Link machine. Abbey National and
Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, also charge.
The network was set up in 1987 enabling banks and building societies without
many cash machines to offer customers a more extensive system and so compete
more effectively with the larger clearing banks.
Initially the system involved no charge to customers while the Link members
paid each other for every transaction by one organisation's customer on
another organisation's machine.
Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society, another large Link member, said
yesterday that against the background of the existing charges levied,
Nationwide's decision was causing it to review 'the commercial options
available'.
The charges imposed by Link members, discouraging use of other
organisations' machines, had already had an impact on the income it received
from the external use of its own machines, the Alliance &amp; Leicester said.
Link said it acknowledged the Nationwide move 'with regret'. The cost to
each member of the 31 organisations in the co-operative scheme was
'substantially less' than the 60p Nationwide was intending to charge, it
said.
If the charges mean that each organisation's customers increasingly make
less use of other organisations' cash machines, it will make the position
particularly difficult for Link members which have few cash machines
themselves and whose customers therefore make great use of other machines.
