FT  05 AUG 92 / Israelis kill guerrillas
ISRAELI soldiers yesterday shot dead three guerrillas who crossed from
Jordan to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Reuter reports.
Two soldiers were wounded in the clash, the first fatal cross-border attack
since Mr Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister last month, the army said. Mr
Rabin said last week Arab guerrillas opposed to Middle East peace talks
might escalate attacks before the negotiations resume in Washington on
August 24. The clash took place midway between two Jewish settlements.
