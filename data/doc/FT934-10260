FT  06 NOV 93 / Tory council bids for health powers
CONSERVATIVE-controlled Wandsworth council in south London has begun
campaigning to take over responsibility for health purchasing from its local
district health authorities.
The move comes at a time of growing debate over whether district health
authorities, which lost their local authority members under the 1991
National Health Service reforms, are sufficiently representative of the
community.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, said yesterday that
healthcare decisions were 'too important to be left to unelected quangos'.
The immediate cause of Wandsworth's action is the threatened closure of its
Queen Mary's Hospital which, said Mr Lister, was a 'grim reminder of what
can happen when a bureaucracy loses touch with the community'.
But involving the council in health purchasing made additional sense now
that local authorities were responsible for community care, he said.
If the council approves the proposal next week, it will be put to Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary. Legislation would be required to
give local authorities health purchasing responsibility, and the government
has no plans to introduce it. But the question of accountability is a
growing issue in the National Health Service.
Earlier this year Mr David Knowles, president of the Institute of Health
Services Management, said the creation of smaller health authorities had
'shifted the balance of their accountability and legitimacy'.
Mrs Bottomley was accused of undermining public accountability further last
month with proposals to abolish regional health authorities, replacing them
with offices of the NHS's central management executive.
The traditional argument against local authority involvement in healthcare
was that they lacked the expertise to manage hospitals.
