FT  06 OCT 93 / Ozone hole is getting bigger
THE Antarctic ozone hole is deeper than ever this year, scientists from the
British Antarctic Survey reported yesterday. Two-thirds of the atmosphere's
ozone layer, which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
has been destroyed by man-made chemicals, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, over
most of the Antarctic continent.
Mr Jonathan Shanklin, a meteorologist at BAS headquarters in Cambridge, said
recent observations from Scott and Halley research stations confounded
predictions there would be some improvement this year on last year's record
ozone destruction.
'This demonstrates once again how little we know about the atmosphere,' Mr
Shanklin said. 'But it also shows how important it is to stop putting CFCs
and other chlorine-containing chem-icals into the atmosphere.'
CFC production is due to stop in industrialised countries by the end of 1994
but their concentration in the atmosphere may not fall until early next
century.
The hole has been a seasonal phenomenon since the late 1970s, appearing
early in the spring as the sun's rays first strike the cocktail of
ozone-destroying chemicals built up over the pole during the long Antarctic
winter. It is deepest in October, then breaks up.
The hole is not yet affecting any populated regions, but is likely to
increase ultraviolet radiation temporarily over southern Chile and Argentina
over the next two months.
A similar but shallower seasonal hole has begun to form over the northern
hemisphere. A record 20 per cent of Arctic ozone was lost this year. The
main effect of ozone loss on human health is to increase cancer risk through
ultraviolet exposure.
