FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Strong showing by outplacement side behind
sharp recovery at DC Gardner
DC GARDNER Group, the outplacement, conference centre and financial training
company which has undergone a substantial restructuring in the past two
years, moved back into profit in 1992, underpinned by a strong performance
by Coutts, its outplacement and career management unit.
Having issued a profits warning and replaced its chief executive in
November, the group yesterday reported annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.22m, compared to a restated loss of Pounds 10.1m in the previous year.
Earnings of 1.85p compared to a loss of 49.19p; the dividend is again
omitted.
The 1991 result was originally reported as a Pounds 3.76m pre-tax loss, but
has been restated to comply with the FRS 3 reporting standard.
Sir Kit McMahon, who took over as non-executive chairman in November, said
1992 had been 'a year of recovery and continued restructuring after the
disappointing results in earlier years.'
The group posted an operating profit of Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.98m loss)
after exceptional costs of Pounds 349,000 (Pounds 3.15m) on turnover of
Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18m).
Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, noted that all three divisions had
improved their performance. In particular operating profits in the core
outplacement division jumped to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.42m) on turnover of
Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.1m).
The division has recently won four contracts worth Pounds 5m. These include
significant IBM and Ministry of Defence outplacement contracts.
The residential conference centres improved operating profit by 22 per cent
to Pounds 1.18m in a 'tough market'.
Losses in the training division were trimmed from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds
360,000.
The division's results were depressed by the Pounds 859,000 (Pounds 760,000)
cost of its Harbour Exchange building in London's docklands.
The year ended with net borrowings at Pounds 2.96m (Pounds 3.77m),
representing gearing of 30 per cent, down from 40 per cent.
