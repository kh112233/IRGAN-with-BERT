CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
DEATH VALLEY; 
RABIES WARNING ISSUED AT MONUMENT 
Visitors to Death Valley National Monument have been warned to stay away from 
wild animals because of the danger of rabies. State Health Director Kenneth 
Kizer said visitors to the monument after Oct. 9 may have been infected with 
rabies if they came in contact with infected foxes, coyotes, bats and other 
meat-eating wild or domestic animals. "One person has been bitten by a rabid 
fox at Stovepipe Wells," Kizer said. "Other foxes from the monument are being 
tested to determine if they are also infected." Pets left outside at night 
could be bitten by a rabies-infected animal and can incubate the disease for 
six months or longer. People who suspect they or their pet have been infected 
should contact local health officials, Kizer said. Infected dogs and cats with 
current vaccinations must be revaccinated and quarantined for 30 days. Pets 
without vaccinations must be quarantined for 6 months or destroyed.
