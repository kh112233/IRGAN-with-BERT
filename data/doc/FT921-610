FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Few women MPs likely
FEWER THAN one in five of the main political parties' election candidates is
a women, according to an Electoral Reform Society analysis carried out after
the close of nominations.
Although there has been a 250 per cent growth in the number of women
candidates since 1979, only 10 per cent of MPs at most in the next
parliament are likely to be women, the society says.
Electoral reform - with either a single transferable vote and multi-member
constituencies, or the German 'additional member' system - would be needed
in order to change the imbalance in the sexes in parliament, the society
concludes.
