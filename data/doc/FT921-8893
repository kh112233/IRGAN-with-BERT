FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology: Machine replaces milkmaid
For the last three years Professor Jim Hewit's team in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering at the Loughborough University of Technology has been
looking at cows' udders with more than a passing interest.
Talking to colleagues at the Agricultural and Food Research Council they
discovered that if cows could be milked as often as the cows themselves
wanted, milk production would increase.
The stress on the cows of being rounded up for milking would also be
reduced, which could improve milk quality. And farmers would need less
equipment, as milking would be spread throughout the day, not compressed
into the traditional early and late shifts.
The Loughborough team has developed a robotic machine to milk the cows
automatically. The system incorporates a thermal imaging system attached to
a contraption of booms and telescopic tubing.
The solution appeared by accident. Hewit discovered a thermal imaging system
in the lab from a previous project. Wondering whether this might distinguish
cold teats from hot udders, the team tested it on cows on an Oxfordshire
farm.
Not only did it pick out the teats on the cow when the animal entered the
milking stall, without the need for human guidance, it also picked out a
teat diseased with mastitis, which appeared black to the imaging system. The
cow's owner was shocked, but grateful, and so were the Loughborough
engineers: in a surprise spin-off the robot had become a dual milking and
diagnostic imaging system.
Work will begin in May on the remaining hurdle: making the imaging systems
rugged enough and cheap enough for life on the farm. At present an effective
imaging system costs around Pounds 30,000, says Hewit, and he is worried
that a roaring trade in robot rustling might develop.
Eventually he believes unattended milking stalls will appear on the farm.
Cows will wander in as they please or be called in by the tape-recorded
lowings of suckling calves.
