Members of a band of Chippewa Indians in Mole Lake, Wis., voted against a state 
proposal for a $10-million buyout to limit the band's hunting and fishing 
treaty rights. Arlyn Ackley, tribal chairman, said the vote was 131-24 against 
the proposal. The state's offer called for paying $1.25 million the first year 
and $1 million a year for the next nine years, he said. In exchange, the band 
would give up treaty spearfishing rights, except for certain ceremonial 
purposes, and lumbering rights on non-reservation public lands. The money would 
have financed the band's tribal administration, economic development projects 
and health and welfare programs.
