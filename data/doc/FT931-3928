FT  13 MAR 93 / Acquittals in car park spying trial
AN INDUSTRIAL espionage trial, involving National Car Parks, ended yesterday
with the acquittals of both defendants and calls for reform of the law
affecting the operation of private security companies.
After a two-month trial, Mr Gordon Layton, chief executive of NCP, the
leading car parks operator, and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former manager with KAS,
a now defunct security company, were acquitted of conspiring to defraud
rival Europarks.
The case has been regarded within the legal profession as the most important
example of industrial espionage to come before the courts and a test of
current legislation.
The Old Bailey jury heard how, at Mr Layton's request, KAS - the company
formed by the late Sir David Stirling, the founder of Britain's Special Air
Service - carried out a three-year espionage operation against Europarks to
acquire confidential information.
The methods included surveillance of directors, searches of offices and the
infiltration of 'moles' into the rival company.
The two defendants argued they thought the operation was inside the law and
had not been intended to damage Europarks.
After their acquittals, Judge Richard Hawkins turned down applications from
both men for their costs to be met from public funds. Lawyers for Mr Layton
said: 'The fact that the trial took place at all has shown the law relating
to private security services to be in a very unsatisfactory state and in
need of clarification.'
NCP had remained confident of Mr Layton's innocence and he would now return
to his work as chief executive, they said.
After the verdicts, the prosecution dropped charges against two others
involved in the espionage operation - Mr Ian Crooke, a former SAS colonel
and KAS manager, and Ms Jane Turpin, a former Army captain who had
infiltrated Europarks for KAS.
