FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fighting toxins with funghi
A small UK company, Biotal, is using fungi to take toxic and other stubborn
residues out of the soil. It makes a compost by mixing in woodchips; a white
rot fungus is grown which produces enzymes to break down the organic
compounds.
In Finland, it has treated soil containing chlorinated phenols which were
quickly reduced to below 10ppm. The process worked in severe winter
conditions and Biotal is researching treatment of soils with other
compounds.
