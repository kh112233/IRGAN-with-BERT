FT  06 AUG 93 / VW shares rise sharply in Frankfurt
Volkswagen shares rose sharply in Frankfurt yesterday on hopes for a
'positive' outcome from tonight's extraordinary meeting of the vehicle
maker's supervisory board, writes Christopher Parkes.
The group's stocks rose DM12.5 to reach DM374 at the official close, but
continued climbing in after-market trading, reaching DM377.20 by late
afternoon.
Dealers said they expected the 20 non-executive directors to re-state their
unconditional support for Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, and Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director. Both men will attend and
present progress reports on restructuring and provide profit forecasts.
The market was also encouraged by Wednesday's announcement that a further
3,000 VW jobs in Germany are to be cut by the end of 1994. This was taken as
a sign of management determination to reduce costs.
By the end of next year the German workforce will have been cut to 100,000.
In the medium-term analysts expect a further 20,000 jobs to go.
The market is also expecting action to restore confidence in the group's
press and public relations activities, which have been shaken by Mr Piech's
abortive efforts to counter allegations of industrial espionage against Mr
Lopez by his former employer, General Motors.
The supervisory board is expected to try to help Mr Piech extricate himself
from what he himself called a 'mud-slinging war' with GM and its German
subsidiary Adam Opel, and return to the business of restoring VW to health.
