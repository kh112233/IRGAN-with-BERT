FT  11 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Japanese plants in UK blamed for Ford
jobs threat
Japanese car companies with plants in Britain were partially blamed by Ford
UK chairman and managing director Ian McAllister for his company's threat to

His attack, in written evidence to the Commons employment committee,
coincided with a vote by Ford's white-collar staff to authorise a strike if
compulsory redundancies go ahead. Page 24; Battle for survival, Page 10
