FT  22 OCT 92 / Birmingham accused of inner-city bias
BIRMINGHAM'S concentration on the regeneration of its city centre with a few
large-scale development projects has failed to secure a fair distribution of
benefits throughout the city and has helped to make social inequality worse,
according to a study published today.
The study, from the University of Central England in Birmingham (formerly
Birmingham Polytechnic), questions the merit of large-scale spending on
projects such as the International Convention Centre (ICC), venue of the
recent EC summit, and the National Indoor Arena.
It includes the premise that 'urban regeneration is not achievable without
social regeneration'.
The examination of Birmingham's performance in seeking to strengthen the
local economy by trickling down wealth from an enlarged services sector in
the city centre to deprived suburbs offers lessons for other UK cities.
In differing degrees, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Bradford
have all followed similar policies, based on the experience of US cities
such as Baltimore, Boston and Detroit in the 1970s.
The authors of the study provide evidence to show that the scale of
Birmingham City Council funding of what they call 'prestige developments'
has diverted resources from education and housing.
They also note that special training schemes aimed at ensuring that
inner-city residents gained access to the 275 full-time jobs at the ICC
resulted in the provision of only 19 jobs, of which 14 were in low-pay
occupations such as cleaning and security.
The ICC has been a focal point of the city council's aspirations to present
Birmingham as an international city.
