FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Past
performance can be a guide - How to choose them, 2 / A researcher explains
why he questions the orthodox wealth warning
There is a widespread view that it is virtually impossible to pick the unit
trust performers of tomorrow based on the performance of yesterday.
But many academics and analysts argue that this is not the case. There does
exist a relationship between past and future performance. Admittedly it is
not widespread, but it is there.
My first rule is to understand that the key to fund selection is to pinpoint
those funds whose past performances provide evidence of managerial ability.
Managerial ability is the critical determinant of long-run investment
success. It is also rare. In fact, it is so uncommon that the total returns
of most unit trusts are caused by a combination of luck and risk, rather
than skill.
Rule two, then, is to be sure that whatever is described as past performance
does in fact measure managerial ability and not luck or skill. In other
words, in order to judge the worth of a past performance, it is necessary to
be clear about the causes of that performance.
Unfortunately, the standard approach to this task simply takes a fund's
total return relative to its sector as evidence of managerial performance.
This is a mistake. When total returns are taken as the sole measure of
performance, all three of the causes of the total return - risk, luck and
skill - are rolled into one. But from the view of performance assessment,
only one of these - skill - is of any real worth.
Table 1 shows the top 20 funds from the International Growth unit trust
sector. They have been ranked in the standard way - offer-to-offer,
cumulative total returns over the five years to the end of August 1994. Now
look at column two, which shows each fund's volatility or risk (as measured
by the standard deviation of each fund's monthly total returns) over the
same five years. The range of risk profiles is huge. Column three, the risk
index, shows that the riskiness of these funds varies from 92 per cent of
the sector average to 163 per cent of the sector average - almost twice as
much.
The fact that the four riskiest funds in this group have four of the five
highest returns is no coincidence. It is evidence of how the fund has
achieved its total return. So my rule three is: always remember that risk
causes return. The widespread failure to understand this is one of the main
reasons why it is difficult to find a relationship between performance past
and future. The relationship exists, but it exists between managerial
ability past and managerial ability future, not total returns past and total
returns future. Rule number four is that returns must always be adjusted for
risk in order to measure managerial ability. Here's an example:
In Table 2, I have again taken the five-year performance of the top 20 funds
from the International Growth sector. This time the funds have been ranked
on the basis of their risk-adjusted or risk/return and the changes in rank
relative to the total return rank in table 1 have also been shown.
Risk/return expresses the amount of return that has been garnered for each
unit of risk. It is calculated by taking each fund's average month on month
offer-to-offer total return, and then dividing this average by the standard
deviation (ie risk) of those monthly total returns. Risk-adjusted returns
enable us to evaluate the worth of each fund's performance. If we know that
risk causes return, then, funds that have a very high risk/return can be
said to have less of their return explained by risk and more by skill. We do
need to know, however, at what point skill is more in play than risk; and
for that we need a benchmark.
The benchmark provides a performance standard with which we can measure the
impact of a fund manager's decision-making. An index, such as the FT-SE-A
All-Share for broadly based UK unit trusts or the S&amp;P 500 for broadly based
US ones, fulfils this role. Indices such as these produce total returns that
are the product of no managerial decisions at all.
Funds that are able to beat the index on a risk-adjusted basis, therefore,
can be said to have added value; if they underperform they have subtracted
it. It is virtually impossible to beat a benchmark or index without superior
information - in other words, skill. The sign of managerial ability, then,
is risk-adjusted outperformance of an appropriate benchmark over a five-year
period. This is rule number five.
Basing decisions on managerial ability also makes great sense, because,
unless something very important changes, skill is stable. This is rule
number six. Understand that, in order for a fund that has done well in the
past to do well in the future, the cause of that success has to follow a
stable pattern. (Remember, this will not show up in the sector total return
rankings).
Take a look at the charts 1 and 2. In Gartmore British Growth's case, the
starting point of the trendline in the chart is the five-year risk-adjusted
performances from December 29, 1986, to December 29, 1991; and for Perpetual
High Income it is the five years to December 29, 1992. The trendline then
shows the pattern of each fund's risk-return as a ratio of the FT-SE-A All
Share's risk/return for each rolling five-year period in the 31 subsequent
months to date for Gartmore British Growth and 19 months for Perpetual High
Income.
The key feature here is whether the fund's trendline is consistently above
the value 1.0. This value represents the risk-adjusted return of the FT-SE-A
All-Share. In both cases, although the risk/return jumps up and down a bit,
the value is always above 1.0; that is, both have consistently outperformed
the All-Share index.
In other words, the managerial ability of both funds has been stable. This
is the type of information upon which fund selection decisions should always
be based. By contrast, the performances of GT Income and M&amp;G Dividend are
consistently below 1.0; that is, they have been consistent value
subtractors, although something important is going on at GT Income. The
chart shows that it has been improving steadily since a new manager was put
in place.
The golden rule in fund selection is to base decisions upon evidence of
managerial ability that is stable. Unless something important gives, this
will ensure that the fund's outperformance of its benchmark in the past will
continue into the future. To base decisions upon relative to sector total
return rankings is just wrong-headed.
