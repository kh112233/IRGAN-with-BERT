FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thailand opens door to offshore
banking
FIFTY-TWO banks have applied to set up offshore banking units in Thailand,
the central bank said. The applicants include 37 foreign institutions and
all 15 Thai commercial banks.
Thai officials are establishing the so-called Bangkok International Banking
Facility in an attempt to make Thailand a financial centre for Indochina and
Burma. However, some commercial bankers believe confusion over tax benefits
for the OBUs is to blame for a lukewarm international response.
All foreign banks which have applied for OBU licences hope to take advantage
of tax concessions, while those banks without branches in Thailand see the
move as a way of entering a restricted banking market.
'I look on this as a stepping stone for full branch status in two to three
years' time,' said Mr Anders Lundquist, chief of Skandinaviska-Enskilda
Banken's representative office in Bangkok.
Other commercial bankers believe the central bank is disappointed by the
number of applications and point to doubts about tax concessions.
