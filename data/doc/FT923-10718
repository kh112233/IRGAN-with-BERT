FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Telmex makes sound first-half
headway
TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telecommunications company,
yesterday reported net profits of 3,638bn pesos (Dollars 1.16bn) for the
first half to June, up 5.4 per cent on the same period last year.
Operating income advanced to 4,297bn pesos, representing a 12.7 per cent
increase in real terms.
This was struck after extraordinary losses in the second quarter of about
192bn pesos covering pension fund contributions and provisions for obsolete
inventory. If the extraordinary losses are excluded, the underlying increase
in operating income was 22.5 per cent, said Mr Robert Morris of Goldman
Sachs, San Francisco.
Second-quarter earnings per American depositary receipt (ADR) were Dollars
1.03. But excluding the extraordinary losses, and an estimated Dollars 70m
loss on Telmex's non-dollar debt in the second quarter, earnings per ADR
rose to Dollars 1.24, according to Mr Morris.
Telmex added 326,000 new telephone lines in the first half. Lines in service
in the second quarter were up 14.6 per cent, while margins, at 43.9 per
cent, were flat. Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, reported
net profits of 339,000m pesos (Dollars 108m) in the first half, practically
unchanged from the same period last year.
Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, blamed the poor results on the US
recession, the strong peso, and low international prices on glass goods.
