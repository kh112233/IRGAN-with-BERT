FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Again out of step with Europe
Sir, Dr Harold Hughes (Letters, January 8) raises some very pertinent
questions concerning passport checks on travellers within the European
Union. The EU is a single market, defined by Article 7a of the EC Treaty as
'an area without internal frontiers'. The UK government claims the article
is subject to 'differing interpretations': but free circulation of goods
within the EU is clearly established in law - so why not free circulation of
people?
Systematic passport controls on travellers within the EU are not essential,
because there are alternatives, based on co-operation between national
authorities, for controlling the movement of terrorists and illegal
immigrants. A blueprint for the necessary measures is provided by the
agreement of nine member states to abolish passport controls at their common
frontiers. The UK, as a non-participant, has not been in a position to
influence this agreement, but may nevertheless have to adopt many of its
elements. The result would no doubt be arrangements more suited to our
continental neighbours than to the UK, thus repeating the history of
Britain's belated membership of the European Community. So much for being at
the heart of Europe.
