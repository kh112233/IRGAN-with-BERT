FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Gummer shows survival knack
MR JOHN GUMMER'S promotion to environment secretary from agriculture
minister shows his capacity for political survival. Party chairman from 1983
to 1985, he had seemed consigned to a series of low-profile jobs in the
Treasury, local government and agriculture.
The move demonstrates his place as one of Mr John Major's political cronies
and part of the 'East Anglia Mafia' - his Suffolk coastal constituency is
close to Mr Major's, and he co-proposed Mr Major for prime minister.
While environmental groups accuse Mr Gummer of having maintained an 'uneasy
silence' on controversial issues such as river pollution, he claimed last
year to be Europe's greenest agriculture minister.
A fluent orator, he has a reputation for easily summoned indignation and for
anti-permissive instincts - he quit the Church of England's general synod
last year in protest at women priests.
But he is known as an enthusiast, not a deep thinker. Mr Chris Smith, shadow
environment secretary said: 'Gummer is a disastrously lightweight
appointment - he will lack seriousness of purpose and lack clout in the
cabinet.'
Mr Gummer's move shows that the environment portfolio is low on the
political agenda now that the council tax appears to have bedded down.
He inherits tricky problems, however, particularly whether to approve
British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said last night the issue would be a
litmus test of his environmental credibility.
