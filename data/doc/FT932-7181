FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Highland and IDV may swoop on NB Distillery
HIGHLAND Distilleries and IDV, Grand Metropolitan's drinks division, are
believed to be preparing a Pounds 100m joint takeover bid for the North
British Distillery, an Edinburgh-based distiller of grain whisky.
North British, an unquoted company with 600 shareholders, announced 11 days
ago that it had received a bid approach, and it declined yesterday to add to
its statement.
The company, established last century by a consortium of wholesale whisky
merchants, supplies grain whisky for Highland's Famous Grouse brand of
blended scotch, and for J&amp;B Rare, IDV's leading whisky brand.
Industry sources suggest that the Highland/IDV move may have been sparked by
fears that another international drinks group, possibly Seagram of Canada,
was considering a bid.
The largest shareholder of North British, with 33 per cent, is Robertson &amp;
Baxter, a whisky blender, which is 35 per cent owned by Highland. North
British, which in turn, has a 4.8 per cent stake, worth about Pounds 17m, in
Highland.
The Edinburgh distiller's strong balance sheet, with cash at the end of
December of Pounds 4.1m, adds to its bid attractions.
Profit before tax last year was Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 31.3m,
slightly below the previous year's results because of the pressures from
surplus stocks in the industry.
