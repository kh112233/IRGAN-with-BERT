FT  11 JAN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week
(Freesia Hybrids)
Various garden varieties and hybrids of Freesia alba and F. armstrongii are
grown for winter and early spring flowering in greenhouses and
conservatories for their very sweetly scented flowers, which are valued for
cutting as well as for house decoration. Colours include white, pink, red,
mauve, lavender, cream and yellow, and some varieties have double flowers.
Seed should be sown anytime in spring in a temperature of 16`-18` C, thinly
in the pots in which they will flower. The plants are supported with small
canes and twine, or with brushy twigs. During the summer, the pots can be
stood outdoors in a sunny, sheltered place, but must come back under cover
in early autumn. After flowering, the corns that have formed during the year
can be repotted in summer and grown for another year, when they will flower
a little earlier.
