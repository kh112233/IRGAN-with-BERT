FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S African shares tumble
Johannesburg tumbled in response to a bank rate rise, higher August
inflation and weaker world markets. A firmer financial rand also hit rand
prices of offshore listed stocks. The overall index fell 138 to 5,617,
industrials lost 157, or 2.5 per cent, at 6,203 and golds slipped 20 to
2,449.
Gold shares, firm early in the session, reversed direction as the bullion
price failed to push ahead towards Dollars 400 an ounce.
De Beers retreated R4 to R99, Anglos fell R4.50 to R237.50 and Gencor
declined 40 cents to R14.
Iscor receded 19 cents to R4.35 following its 12-cent advance on Friday.
Remgro dipped 75 cents to R24.50, Richemont was R1.25 cheaper at R39.75 and
Minorco relinquished R3.25 at R110.
