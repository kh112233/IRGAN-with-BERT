FT  29 APR 94 / Thai economic growth continues
Thailand's expanding economy produced a 16.8 per cent rise in exports and a
12.4 per cent increase in imports in the first quarter, but Bank of Thailand
statistics yesterday show higher inflation.
Consumer prices rose 4.8 per cent in the quarter. The bank wants to hold
inflation at 4.2 per cent this year, against 3.3 per cent in the last
quarter of 1993.
The relative decline in Thai interest rates and a slide in Bangkok share
prices chased out 'hot money', non-resident baht accounts and portfolio
investments. More surprisingly, foreign direct investment showed no
recovery, after a 29 per cent fall in 1993.
Mrs Tanya Sirivedhin, head of economic research at the bank, said other
countries such as Malaysia had also recently been affected by a slowdown in
direct foreign investment, following generally slow growth in western
economies.
The current account deficit shrank slightly to Bt44bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the
opening quarter against Bt48bn in 1993.
Industrial production rose 8.5 per cent in the first quarter compared with
1993, below the central bank's target of 9.7 per cent for the year.
