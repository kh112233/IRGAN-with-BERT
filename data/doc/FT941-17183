FT  06 JAN 94 / Georgia's ex-leader reported dead
Confusion surrounded the fate last night of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the
ousted president of Georgia.
According to the Itar Tass official news agency, he committed suicide on
December 31. However, Mr Gamsakhurdia's Moscow spokesman said he had seen
him alive on Saturday, a day after his reported death. But he could not say
whether he was still alive.
Quoting the former president's wife, Manana, Itar Tass said earlier in the
day that he had taken his own life after being surrounded at night by
'unknown men' in an area in western Georgia following the collapse last
October of his attempt to retake power from Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the
current Georgian head of state.
However, the Georgian security ministry said that its intelligence sources
believed he had been shot in Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of
Chechnya, where he had taken refuge since his violent overthrow in January
1992.
