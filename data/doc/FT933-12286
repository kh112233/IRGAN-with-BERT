FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Dollars 3 notes; Samoan warriors; jungle retreat
Among the minor businesses of the Cook Islands - there are no major ones,
though they are trying to grow coffee and vanilla - is the currency. It is
tied to the New Zealand dollar, but is supplemented by some unique mintings
which cannot be used abroad, even in New Zealand. The paper money, designed
by a resident American, includes one of the world's few Dollars 3 notes.
Among the coinage are a 12-sided 50-cent piece, a triangular Dollars 2, and
a wavy-edged Dollars 1 coin featuring the god Tangaroa - naked, and so
well-endowed that Queen Elizabeth II was said to have been extremely
hesitant about appearing on the other side.
A recent component of the Pacific myth is rugby, played hard and fast; and
the current champions are Manu Samoa ('Samoan warriors'), who embarrassed
Wales in the World Cup and frequently contribute players to New Zealand's
All Blacks. We went to watch them play Scotland in Apia. The Scots, tired
and hot, kicked a lot. Manu Samoa, gloriously, ran the ball from everywhere,
and won 28-11. The crowd cheered their three tries but otherwise, though
delighted with the result, were unexpectedly quiet and decorous - closer to
Lord's than Twickenham. More than other islanders, Samoans are a reserved
people.
Eccentric hotel of the year must be Hana Iti, on the Tahitian island of
Huahine. American Thomas Kurth has built a series of bungalows, according to
whim, scattered around a hillside; some are built into cliff faces, others
in or around trees, all partly open to the elements.
No two are the same; four-wheel drive vehicles are the only way of moving
between them. We made the mistake of arriving after dark; for some, the
prospect of a night in a door-less chalet in an unseen jungle was
offputting. As long as you are prepared for the isolation, though, this
could be the unique battery- recharging experience Kurth planned.
