FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Whitecroft nets Pounds 6m on option sale
Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based light fittings, fire doors and medical fibres
manufacturer, has made nearly Pounds 6m cash profit by selling an option on
a Stockport retail centre.
The money will further reduce Whitecroft's borrowings. These stood at Pounds
30m at its half year end last December, but then fell to less than Pounds
25m after the sale of a property development at Hillsborough, Sheffield.
The option to buy the Stockport centre was a condition of the centre's sale
 -by a then distressed Whitecroft - at a reduced price to Confederation Life
Insurance in 1991. It was in Whitecroft's books at Pounds 800,000 and
produced no income. Confederation Life is paying Pounds 6.75m for it.
Whitecroft's financial year has just ended, so it cannot be specific about
the effect. However, borrowings are almost certainly now below Pounds 20m.
Gearing was 100 per cent after the Hillsborough deal.
The group was nearly brought down in the recession by the falling value of a
property portfolio built up in the late 1980s. It has since reverted to its
core manufacturing businesses. Remaining properties are two medium-sized
office developments in the south of England, but these are now unlikely to
be sold until they are fully let.
