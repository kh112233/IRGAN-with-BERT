FT  22 JUL 94 / Car production likely to reach 21-year high
Car production this year is likely to reach a 21-year high if export trends
indicated by industry statistics yesterday are sustained.
Production for export in June, at 48,213, jumped by more than 20 per cent on
a year-on-year basis for the second month in succession, strengthening the
industry's hopes that continental Europe's car market recovery is
accelerating after one of its sharpest recessions on record.
With the UK market already restored to health - record sales are being
forecast for August - the export performance helped lift total car output.
In June it was 145,078, up 7.7 per cent compared with the same month a year
ago.
Industry analysts believe that market conditions in both the UK and on the
Continent should allow production to strengthen further for the remainder of
the year, lifting it well clear of the 1,375,523 cars produced last year -
itself the highest output since 1974.
Increasing economic activity in the UK is also reflected in statistics for
commercial vehicle output. This rose to 21,328 in June, up 27.2 per cent on
a year-on-year basis. Within this total, output for export rose only 9.4 per
cent, to 7,032, while production for the domestic market soared by 38 per
cent to 14,296.
June's performance lifted total car output for the first half of this year
to 751,872. This was only 1.2 per cent higher than in the first half of
1993, a reflection of the continuing recession in the opening months of the
year in continental Europe's markets, and that the UK's market was only just
starting to emerge from recession.
Production for export in the year's first half, at 292,699, was 1.8 per cent
higher than a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office.
The UK industry's performance is boosted by the rapid increase in production
by Toyota and Honda, whose UK plants went on stream at the beginning of last
year.
Commercial vehicle output in the first half of the year reached 116,627, a
10.2 per cent rise on a year ago.
