FT  04 MAY 91 / Collecting: Impressionist catalogues of woe / Thumb through
slim prospectuses for the NY sales
until last November the most glamorous events on the international auction
calendar - are limp little volumes. There are none of those hardback
single-owner sale catalogues that we had become accustomed to in recent
years, just 'Impressionist and Modern Paintings and Sculpture' Parts I and
II from both auction houses and separate catalogues for Drawings and
Watercolours.
Sotheby's sales, starting on Tuesday evening continues the next morning;
Christie's stages its main auction on Wednesday evening and Part II the
following day. No-one, least of all the auction houses, is looking forward
to the occasions very much.
In Part I, Sotheby's is offering 47 lots in a session which is estimated to
bring in between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m (Pounds 16.8m and Pounds
22.5m); Christie's has 58 lots with a presale estimate of Dollars 34.4m to
Dollars 46.6m. When one remembers that only this time last year Christie's
obtained the highest sum ever paid at auction for any art work - Van Gogh's
Dollars 82.5m 'Portrait of Dr Gachet' - in a sale which totalled Dollars
269.4m and Sotheby's Impressionists at the same time came to Dollars 286.2m,
it is not surprising that this season's auctions look limp.
It was at the Impressionist sales in New York last November that this area
of the art market was largely redefined. First, a Van Gogh 'Flowerpiece' -
until then one of the most sought-after types of picture - with an estimate
of Dollars 12m to Dollars 16m was bought-in at Christie's when it reached
Dollars 9m; but in the same sale another Van Gogh, a pen and ink drawing
that was much less glamorous, went above its pre-sale estimate and fetched
Dollars 8.36m.
The lesson to be learned from this is that even last November the market for
more specialised types of art held up. This was borne out when a fine early
charcoal drawing of a head by Picasso exceeded its top estimate of Dollars
2m to fetch Dollars 2.09m at Christie's, while a trio of later canvasses of
the type which the artist turned out by the score remained unsold.
The collector-speculators who until then would pay anything just for the
name Picasso had obviously stayed at home, paving the way for more serious
buyers. That is why at Sotheby's the same week Dollars 2.5m (against an
estimate of Dollars 1m) was paid for an ugly but important sculpture by
Picasso, 'Verre d'Absinthe.'
There is evidence in next week's catalogues that, based on last November's
results, everyone - vendors, purchasers and auctioneers - now has a more
realistic approach when it comes to estimates.
Three paintings by Picasso at Christie's next week - all in some way
slightly out of the ordinary - are modestly estimated: the most expensive is
a 1937 still-life (Dollars 700,000 to Dollars 900,000) while a signed pen
and ink drawing of 1926 is even more reasonable at Dollars 150,000 to
Dollars 200,000.
Then there is the case of Monet. At both Sotheby's and Christie's in the
autumn, 'Water Lily' paintings by this artist did relatively well; but a
landscape by him dating from the 1880s which had a high estimate of Dollars
3.5m to Dollars 4.5m failed to sell at Christie's. A much more attractive
Monet of the same period, a view of Antibes, will be auctioned by the same
house next week: it carries a much lower estimate of Dollars 2m to Dollars
3m.
There are five paintings by Chagall in Christie's sale, of which a
dream-like composition of 1949 is the finest (estimate Dollars 4m to Dollars
5m). A Degas pastel of a woman scrubbing herself with a sponge - not one of
his most attractive works - is estimated at Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m.
Among the surprises at Sotheby's sale last November was the success of two
Surrealist paintings by Magritte, both of which exceeded their estimates to
fetch Dollars 1.21m and Dollars 1.75m respectively. These results have
encouraged vendors with Surrealist paintings to enter the market.
Christie's has five canvasses by de Chirico next week, including the
artist's Self-portrait (estimate Dollars 180,000 to Dollars 220,000) and a
large 1927 work, 'Gli Archeologi' (estimate Dollars 800,000 to Dollars 1m).
It also has a fine Delvaux of 1938, 'La Vie endormie' (estimate Dollars 1m
to Dollars 1.5m); a Magritte (Dollars 1.2m to Dollars 1.6m); and works in
similar vein by Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dali, Balthus and Picabia.
An attractive 1940 Matisse of a woman seated patiently at a table, 'La Robe
Persane,' is reproduced on the cover of Sotheby's Impressionist catalogue:
estimated at Dollars 5m to Dollars 7m, it is one of five works by the artist
 -two of them sculptures - in the sale.
A tiny Fauve landscape of Collioure by this artist is expected to fetch
Dollars 700,000 to Dollars 900,000 and one of his still life paintings,
dated 1921, Dollars 1m to Dollars 1.5m. There are three fairly modest
pastels by Degas with estimates that vary between Dollars 400,000 and
Dollars 1.8m and three canvasses by Chagall, of which a 1970 work is
estimated highest at Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m.
Two Picasso oils, one of 1959, the other from 1969, are optimistically
estimated at Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m and Dollars 1.75m to Dollars 2.25m
respectively; a Renoir still life is Dollars 900,000 to Dollars 1.2m; and a
Miro of 1939 is Dollars 1m to Dollars 1.5m. A group of four little
watercolour studies by Cezanne - all of them with drawings on both the front
and back of the paper - are estimated at Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000
each.
Several less familiar artists are included in Sotheby's sale: Rufino Tamayo,
Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Matta and Wilfredo Lam. Their inclusion among the
Pantheon of great Impressionist and Modern artists is certainly a sign of
the times.
