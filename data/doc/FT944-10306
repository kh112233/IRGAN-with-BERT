FT  11 NOV 94 / Bell rings at end of six-year dispute
Yesterday's curriculum announcement may have been the final act of a dispute
which has convulsed education since 1988.
The concept of a national curriculum had broad backing when it was
introduced as part of Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act. Religious and
physical education had previously been the only compulsory subjects, and
education in England and Wales was felt to be wildly out of step with that
of other European Union nations.
However, Mr Baker split with his prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, over
the form the curriculum should take. She favoured a curriculum that simply
ensured all children had been taught a basic core of subjects. Mr Baker,
whose view prevailed, preferred a more ambitious prescriptive curriculum.
Once the officials at the education department started drawing up the
curriculum a second problem became apparent. The current education
secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, referred to it yesterday: 'It is
understandable that when you set up a national curriculum there is likely to
be a tension between looking after teachers' workload, and the desire from
subject specialists to put more and more and more into the curriculum.'
As a result, teachers complained that the original curriculum, compiled by
enthusiastic subject experts, took up all of class time.
Testing proved a second - and critical - problem. The curriculum had been
designed for continuous assessment by teachers, with long descriptions of
pupils' attainments and tasks for children to perform. Its tests were meant
simply to help 'diagnose' individual pupils' problems.
But in 1991 Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education secretary, announced plans to
publish league tables of schools' performances in the tests. He appointed
Lord Griffiths, chairman of the rightwing Institute of Policy Studies
think-tank, to run the quango administering the curriculum. His brief was to
produce simple 'paper and pencil' tests.
The first tests for 14-year-olds were scheduled to be taken in 1993.
However, English teachers reacted angrily to the first draft test papers
published in January. All three of the main teachers' unions boycotted the
tests. They were taken in less than 5 per cent of state schools.
Mr John Patten, who succeeded Mr Clarke, appointed Sir Ron Dearing to review
the curriculum in April 1993, in an attempt to persuade the teachers to
abandon their boycott. It failed.
Sir Ron appeared yesterday to have produced a package which would keep Mrs
Shephard in position rather longer than her predecessors.

THE FINAL REVISION: WHAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The national curriculum must be studied in all state schools in England
and Wales, by children aged 5-16. Its compulsory core subjects are
English, mathematics, science and design &amp; technology. Subsidiary
subjects are modern languages (compulsory only from age 11), information
technology and physical education (both compulsory throughout); and
history, geography, art and music (optional from age 14). Children are
expected to have been taught certain subjects and topics by the end of
'key stages' one (at age 7), two (11), three (14) and four (16). At the
end of each key stage, children must be assessed on whether they have
reached defined attainment targets. This is checked by pupils' coverage
of 200 'level descriptions' which describe the level they should have
reached. Assessment in each subject follows a 10-level scale. The aim is
for the most able to reach level 10 by age 16.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage one (age 7):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils must be introduced 'with appropriate sensitivity' to the
  importance of standard English.
Maths: emphasis is on mastering basic arithmetic (addition, division,
  subtraction, multiplication).
Science: pupils should be taught about 'systematic enquiry', and science
  'in everyday life'. Basic biology and physics.
The main changes: Tougher on traditional grammar than before. Proposals
  to correct pupils for speaking non-standard English, even in the
  playground, have been dropped.
  Study of specifically British history compulsory for the first time.
  In science, study of electricity is now compulsory.
  In maths, children must learn to work without calculators.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage two (age 11):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils to learn to plan, draft, revise, proof-read and present
  written material, and read 'a range of modern fiction by significant
  children's authors'.
Maths: applied mathematics, including interpreting basic statistics,
  probability theory, and building 2- and 3-dimensional shapes.
Science: work on materials, building simple electrical circuits,
  basic astronomy.
Technology: pupils to work with 'a range of materials and components',
  and recognise hazards.
The main changes: There is to be more emphasis on mental arithmetic in
  maths and less work on nutrition in science. Work on energy and
  resources deferred until secondary school. The requirement to study
  the history of technology dropped. Pupils are to attempt a recognised
  version of a team game in PE.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage three (age 14):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: students to have read at least two Shakespeare plays, plus a
  range of classic authors.
Maths: pupils should use graphs, algebra, geometry.
Science: biology, chemistry and physics.
Technology: pupils must learn designing skills and about systems and
  control.
The main changes: Requirement on number of different technology subjects
  to be covered dropped. Pupils can specialise in only one.
  Algebra and number made separate mathematical topics.
  Reading list of prescribed pre-20th century writers but teachers can
  choose their own 20th-century authors.
  Extra emphasis on IT and media studies.
  Extra coverage of chemistry within general science.
  British history to be 'set in European and world perspective'.
