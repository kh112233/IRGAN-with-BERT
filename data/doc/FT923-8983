FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia expects tin profit
after cost-cutting
INDONESIA'S TIN industry is expected to return to profit in 1992 with the
dominant state-owned tin mine, Tambang Timah, having cut production costs by
25 per cent since 1990.
Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the resources minister, said this week that
Tambang, which accounts for 80 per cent of national production, had cut
production costs to Dollars 5,000 a tonne, down from about Dollars 6,700 in
1990.
Tambang is undertaking a five-year restructuring programme entailing a sharp
reduction in the company's workforce from 24,000 two years ago to 8,250. The
company is expected to concentrate its operations at the offshore areas of
Karimun and Kundur islands.
Mr Kartasasmita set a target to reduce production costs to Dollars 4,500 a
tonne. He welcomed the current international tin price of about Dollars
7,000, as against the forecast price of Dollars 5,800 for the year. He
warned, however, that the price could drop if the US decided to run down its
tin stockpiles.
Indonesia is the world's third largest tin producer after Brazil and
Malaysia and had an export quota at the end of last year of 28,376 tonnes a
year under the Association of Tin Producing Countries' market stabilisation
scheme. In 1990 Indonesia produced about 34,000 tonnes of tin.
Indonesia is to host the next meeting of the association in September and
has requested that Brazil and China, which are not members, attend to
discuss world production levels.
PT Freeport, Indonesia's leading copper mining company, is expected to begin
construction of a Dollars 500m copper processing plant next year.
The state-owned Antara news agency reported yesterday that the plant would
produce 150,000 tonnes of copper a year, of which about 90,000 would be
exported.
Freeport has been undertaking a Dollars 550m expansion programme at its
mines in Irian Jaya to increase copper-ore production to about 57,000 tonnes
a day.
Indonesia's exports of copper concentrate last year earned Dollars 512m.
Freeport also produces gold as a by-product of the copper-concentrate
process and exports totalled 9,355 kg in 1990.
The new plant, located in East Java, is to be constructed by
Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which will take substantial equity in the
project.
