FT  10 FEB 93 / Brazil's satellite to monitor rainforests
BRAZIL yesterday moved into the space age with the successful launch of its
first satellite.
The SCD-1, developed entirely in Brazil, was launched from the Kennedy Space
Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida yesterday morning - the culmination of a
Dollars 150m (Pounds 99.3m) project begun in 1979. In recent years the
programme has suffered long delays caused by the perilous state of Brazilian
government finances.
Orbiting 750km above earth, the satellite will be used for collecting
meteorological and environmental data about the Amazon rainforest. The data
will be transmitted to the Brazilian space institute (INPE) for monitoring
forest fires and the concentration of carbon monoxide and dioxide in the
atmosphere. Landsat, the American satellite used for capturing images does
not provide such detail.
Mr Pawal Rosenveld, head of satellite monitoring at INPE, said yesterday:
'This is a technological and political success as it puts Brazil in the club
of countries which have the knowhow for satellite manufacture.'
The satellite was launched using the Pegasus rocket made by the American
Orbital Science Corporation. A second Brazilian-made satellite SCD-2 is
planned to be launched at the end of this year with a Brazilian made rocket.
