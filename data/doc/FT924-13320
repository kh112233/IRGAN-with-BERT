FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Bush election cruise sails
perilously near the rocks - Why lack of strategy helped to undermine the
President's re-election battle
TWELVE months ago, it did not appear that President George Bush would need
much strategy to win re-election. Riding high in the opinion polls after the
military and diplomatic triumphs of the Gulf War, with reasonable
predictions of economic recovery for 1992, and with the leading lights of
the Democratic Party unwilling to take him on, he could have been excused
for anticipating a leisure cruise to a second term.
When things first began to go awry - the Senate by-election loss in
Pennsylvania last November, the disastrous trip to Japan in January and the
general emergence from the warm Gulf hangover - Mr Bush and his advisers
still seemed more puzzled than worried. Then along came Mr Pat Buchanan and
his right-wing insurgency.
Mr Bush seemed torn between a compulsion to compete with Mr Buchanan for
President Reagan's right-wing cohorts, who had helped him to victory in
1988, and treating the polemicist with presidential disdain while
proclaiming the virtues of the middle ground. Though never a real threat for
the Republican nomination, Mr Buchanan succeeded in preventing Mr Bush from
staking out any kind of early strategic position beyond proclamation of his
experience.
In contrast, Governor Bill Clinton's long run always had a consistent
strategic purpose. Still pinned to the board in his Little Rock war-room is
the slogan 'the economy, stupid' - an admonition to the candidate and his
campaign never to swerve from this central issue.
From the very beginning, there was a proliferation of position papers on
every known social and economic policy subject. Mr Paul Tsongas, with some
temporary success, was equally explicit.
The second string was an equally clear determination to rid the Democratic
Party of its left-wing baggage to make it more acceptable to the white and
suburban vote that had gone Republican in droves during the last three
elections.
This meant not only winning primaries but also handling the traditional
party power bases, organised labour and the Rev Jesse Jackson, the black
leader, in such a way as to make it clear that the candidate was beholden to
neither.
Simultaneously, as Mr Bush's team of advisers was increasingly seen
bickering - with Mr Sam Skinner making a hash of the pivotal post of White
House chief of staff - the Clinton core was toughened and united by the
adversity of all the stories about the candidate's private life.
Amid the debate over Vice-President Dan Quayle's presence on the Republican
ticket, Mr Clinton defied the conventional wisdom by choosing Senator Al
Gore, a man of his own age and beliefs and from the same part of the
country.
Consistency was successfully portrayed as a virtue and the Democratic
convention in New York in July was a display case for the candidate's
centrism, run with an efficiency once typical of Republicans.
Mr Ross Perot streaked across the springtime political sky, potentially
upsetting all political calculations. But he disappeared abruptly in July,
only to resurface with a month to go. An eye-catching performance in the
first debate has reignited interest in his independent candidacy, but almost
certainly not to the point that he could win the White House.
The sudden surge from last to first by Mr Clinton in July put the Bush
campaign very much on the strategic spot, not least because Mr Clinton
refused to sit on his new lead. The immensely successful post-convention bus
tours of the mid-west and the farm belt preserved momentum at precisely the
time four years before that Mr Michael Dukakis took a holiday and squandered
his.
If New York in July was Mr Clinton's apex, Houston in August was Mr Bush's
nadir. Patently needing to reclaim the middle ground, his campaign allowed
the far right to dominate the convention with its exclusionary dogma.
Mr Bush may actually have given a better acceptance address than Mr Clinton
a month before, but the messages from Houston were dominated by the
apocalyptic warnings of religious, social and cultural wars pouring from the
mouths of Mr Buchanan, the Rev Pat Robertson and Mrs Marilyn Quayle.
Deprived of a convention 'bounce,' Mr James Baker, back in the White House
saddle, was left pretty much devising strategy from scratch. Initially, this
involved some serious attempts to differentiate the president's economic
philosophies from Mr Clinton's but, as this too failed to take hold, the
approach became progressively negative, first with assaults on Mr Clinton's
record in Arkansas and later with the scarcely veiled suggestions that he
was unpatriotic and even a coward.
Even some traditional Republican advantages - such as finance - became less
overwhelming. Both candidates receive equal federal funding (about Dollars
55m each), but the Democrats normally find it harder to raise money from
individual and corporate contributions. However, they raised Dollars 43.5m
from July to September, and the Republicans only Dollars 26.7m. This still
left the Republicans with a cumulative edge of Dollars 96.2m to Dollars
69.8m, but it means Mr Clinton has not been short of funds in the home
stretch, where it matters.
The electoral map has also begun to look less lopsided. The last three
Republican victories were based on dominance south of the Mason-Dixon line
and west of the Mississippi, with a reasonable split elsewhere. The
Democratic choice of Mr Clinton, a border southerner, threw down a gauntlet
in the Republican heartland.
Mr Bush has never been very popular in California, carrying it only narrowly
in 1988. Now it seems long gone, Texas and the deep south look fragile and
the mountain states, with their own brand of rugged independence, are
unpredictable. Thus, Mr Bush must do much better than he had any reason to
hope in the industrial mid-west in order to have a chance. That is a part of
the country where, as in California, the recession has bitten most deeply.
The US is now a very fragmented electoral market and endorsements matter
much less than they used to. Voter participation remains low, especially
among minorities, which tends to help Republicans. This year only Mr Perot
can be said to have generated real enthusiasm, but, with the possible
exception of the Christian right, it is the Democrats who have been
conducting the more effective registration drives.
Also, while holding on to liberal Democratic constituencies, Mr Clinton has
secured some transfers of allegiance from the traditionally solid Republican
corporate sector on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.
Powerful lobbies, such as the National Rifle Association and the various
ex-servicemen's groups, have been less public in support of Mr Bush than is
usual. One, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, made the firing of a cabinet
member a condition for its backing. Mr Bush's refusal to go the last mile in
supporting the Brady bill, controlling hand-gun sales, led to a very belated
and lukewarm endorsement from the leading police officers' association.
There is a widespread assumption that the largest single voting bloc - women
 -has sharply turned against the president, because of his opposition to
abortion, family leave and other issues of importance to women, not least
the provision of economic opportunity. It is not a coincidence that, of the
record number of 11 women running for the Senate this year, 10 are
Democrats.
Mr Clinton's identification with local Democratic candidates seems much
closer than Mr Bush's to Republicans. In states like California and
Illinois, with popular women Senate candidates, the benefit to Mr Clinton
may be considerable.
In general, the prevalent anti-incumbent mood does not now seem to threaten
Democratic control of Congress and Mr Bush's attempt to blame everything on
the those running the legislature simply has not taken hold.
With 57 current Senate seats, the Democrats are now openly talking of ending
up with at least 60, which happens to be the majority needed to invoke
'cloture' and push legislation through. There will be many new faces in
Congress - perhaps more than in any post-war election - but their party
loyalties and their legislative agendas remain obscure.
The ultimate Republican tactical weapon has been to try and repeat the
success wrought by negative advertising in 1988. Mr Clinton is, on personal
grounds, an unusually vulnerable presidential candidate. But what worked
four years ago has been less effective this year.
The Conservative Party's campaign tactics in Britain this spring have been
the model for the Bush Republicans, but it is not always automatic that
political tactics import easily.
In particular the absence of the late Mr Lee Atwater has deprived Mr Bush's
effort of an instinct for the jugular.
In the last analysis, however, the strategic and tactical factors cannot by
themselves win an election if the country has lost sympathy with the
character of a candidate, incumbent or otherwise, or if the great common
denominator, the economy, has turned sour.
This was the great lesson of 1980, which 1992 in many respects now
resembles.

THE BATTLE FOR ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The West
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads not only in traditionally Democratic states like
Washington and Oregon, and in more marginal Colorado, but even in the
Republican stronghold of Arizona, which gave Bush more than 60 per cent
of its votes in 1988. Most importantly, the economic recession in
California appears to have given Clinton an unassailable lead in this
state with the most electoral weight in the US.

The Midwest
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush campaigners have all but given up hope in Illinois, and Clinton
also appears comfortably ahead in the Great Lakes industrial states of
Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In conservative Indiana, and
out on the praries of Nebraska, Bush retains a lead, but even Kansas, so
heavily Republican that it is usually left out of presidential
calculations, is leaning to Clinton.

The South
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
While the South continues to vote Democratic in congressional elections,
its presidential votes have been solidly Republican in recent years.
But southerners Clinton and Gore stand to win their home states,
Arkansas and Tennessee respectively. They also hold leads in Georgia,
Kentucky and even in North Carolina. Bush is fighting to hold Texas and
Florida.

The East
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Liberal New York and Massachusetts remain firmly in the Clinton camp,
but the Democratic candidate has also won leads in Delaware, Maine and
New Jersey, which gave more than 55 per cent of their votes to Bush in
1988. Even New Hampshire, deeply conservative but one of the states
hardest hit by the recession, has deserted Bush. Clinton could sweep
through the entire region.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads
Maine                 4
Vermont               3
Massachusetts        12

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton landslide?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
If the states vote on November 3 as these polls suggest they could,
Clinton would take at least 36 states plus the District of Columbia,
with Bush winning in only 11 to 14 states. This would translate into a
landslide in terms of the 538 electoral college votes.
Excludes Florida, Oklahoma &amp; N. Dakota as too close to predict.
