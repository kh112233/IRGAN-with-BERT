FT  17 JAN 92 / Big rise in attacks on foreigners
The number of attacks on foreigners in Germany increased tenfold in 1991 to
2,368, according to a confidential government report disclosed by a Berlin
newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
The problem has prompted a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangs and greater
effort to protect foreigners. The report recorded hundreds of fire bombings
of hostels for asylum-seekers as well as physical assaults on individuals.
It said most of the culprits were neo-Nazi skinheads and right-wing high
school students, apprentices or unemployed young people.
