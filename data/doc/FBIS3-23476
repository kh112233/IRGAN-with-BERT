  [Text] Sydney, March 19 (AFP) -- Greek religious leaders 
held a special mass here Saturday after their orthodox church 
was set on fire amid ethnic tensions between Greek and 
Macedonian communities. 
  Firefighters were called late Friday to St Efimia's Greek 
Orthodox Church in the western Sydney suburb of Bankstown, 
within Prime Minister Paul Keating's constituency. 
  The front double doors were ablaze and police said a 
four-litre can which might have contained fuel was discovered 
outside. A police spokesman said it was too early to say 
whether it was linked to the Greek-Macedonian tensions. 
  Earlier this month, a Greek community centre [see previous 
Terrorism Report] and the offices of a state MP, Alex 
Andrianopoulos, were firebombed in Melbourne following 
Australia's recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia on February 15. 
  Greece insists that the use of the term, "Macedonia", 
applies 
only to a northern Greek province of the same name and has 
accused authorities in the former Yugoslav republic of 
harbouring territorial designs on Greek territory. 
  Macedonians have also complained that the Australian 
government caved in to Greek lobbying when it decided on Monday 
to refer to them officially as Slav Macedonians. 
  There are about 700,000 Greek Australians -- a large 
majority 
of whom live in Melbourne -- with about 25,000 of them having 
roots in Macedonia.
