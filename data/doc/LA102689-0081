SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGIONAL; 
6 HEROIC CITIZENS HONORED 
Lee Bibbie of Altadena, who saved a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy last 
August, was among six people whose heroism was recognized Monday in a 
"Courageous Citizens Award" ceremony at the Van Nuys Courthouse. 
Bibbie saved the deputy after an assailant struck him and tried to strangle him 
in a Palmdale bank. The attacker was convicted of forgery and sentenced to four 
years in prison, authorities said. 
Evelyn Jones, 42, of Pasadena, who jumped into her car and chased a young man 
on a bicycle who had stolen her purse, also was honored. Jones eventually 
flagged down a patrolman, who arrested the thief. 
Four men were honored for participating in the capture and disarming of a 
robber: Samuel Luffman, 65, who was with his 97-year-old father when they were 
held up; Steven Kelley, a Sherman Oaks church custodian, and Antonio Perez and 
John Vallejo, employees of a Sun Valley termite extermination company. 
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner presented the awards.
