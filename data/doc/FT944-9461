FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (14): Belgium's dinosaur is put
to rest - Brussels
Belgium's international airport in Brussels has long suffered the strain of
serving thousands of Eurocrats, business travellers, MEPs and their families
who have migrated to Europe's capital since the 1960s.
Built in 1958 for the World Expo in Brussels, it preceded the influx of
people working for European institutions and was created in order to serve
6.6m passengers per year. Last year, that limit was exceeded by 4m.
The crowded terminal, lengthy waits at passport control and old-fashioned
baggage carousels will next month become history.
Brussels Airport Terminal Company (BATC) has invested BFr20bn in a new
terminal which is due to open on December 11. The terminal will be big
enough to shift some 15m passengers per year, a limit it is rapidly expected
to meet.
The new concourse represents only phase one of a master plan for the
airport. Well served with runways - Zaventem has three - BATC says it hopes
to construct another concourse by the year 2,000.
The developments which are due to open next month are particularly important
for Belgium, a member of the Schengen free travel agreement which covers all
EU countries except the UK, Denmark and Ireland.
This will come into place some time in the new year and will allow the
Belgian authorities to separate easily Schengen passengers, who will not be
required to show their passports at the immigration counter, from passengers
from the rest of the world, who will.
With one of the highest percentages of business travellers in Europe, the
new concourse has been built with a special eye to their needs.
An unwritten goal for BATC is that at non-peak hours, it should only take
passengers 20 minutes from when they park their car, or alight from their
taxi, to when they board the plane.
The new concourse will also house a business centre, with meeting rooms and
offering secretarial services.
