FT  17 OCT 94 / UK-Argentine gas venture
British Gas and YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, have been
discussing the formation of a joint venture to explore for hydrocarbons in
disputed South Atlantic waters. 'We would both like to form a long-term
partnership,' said Mr John Bueno, general manager of British Gas Argentina.
Such an alliance would, in addition to other projects, seek to explore
waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands.
British Gas already has a big presence in Argentina with important stakes in
privatised gas distribution and power companies. But Mr Bueno stressed that
talks between the companies could go no further until the British and
Argentine governments had constructed the political framework within which
exploration could proceed. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war
over the Falklands, it has not relinquished its claim over the islands,
ownership of which was recently enshrined in the constitution. Buenos Aires
disputes Britain's right unilaterally to exploit a non-renewable resource in
internationally disputed waters.
