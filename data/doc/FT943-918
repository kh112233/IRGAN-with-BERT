FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Criticism of progress in India
Sir, Stefan Wagstyl's analysis of India's economy ('Not nearly radical
enough,' September 19) deserves praise as it was very constructive and
accurate.
I also trade with a very reputable Indian company and all the Indian
businessmen I meet are unanimous in their criticism of the slow progress of
Indian economic reforms. There are still many areas where the reforms have
not achieved any real change. Foreign investors still have to pay hefty
capital import duties for machinery. Interstate taxes also need urgent
reforms.
As for Srichand Hinduja's letter (September 22) criticising Stefan Wagstyl's
article, I cannot see it serving any useful purpose other than highlighting
his involvement in power plant developments in India. It is also interesting
to note Gordon Wu of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong is planning Dollars
12.7bn power plants in India. This is even better news for India.
