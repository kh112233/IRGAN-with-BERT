  [Text] Sanaa, 28 Jan (INA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has urged all 
Yemeni politicians abroad to return to Yemen and contribute to 
the construction process in the wake of the recently approved 
document of understanding among the Yemeni parties. 
  In statements published by the Yemeni newspapers today, 
al-Bid said among the national personalities whose return is 
sought are former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
'Abdallah al-Asnaj, Ibrahim al-Wazir, 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, 
'Abdallah 'Abd-al-'Alim, Dr. Ahmad al-Asbahi, and others. 
  The Yemeni vice president said the real test facing Yemen at 
the present stage is the implementation of the recent agreement, 
and emphasized that his party is committed to the implementation 
of the agreement. 
  Al-Bid warned against destabilizing the southern parts of 
the 
country and threatening those working in oil companies. He said 
that this situation has forced him to redeploy some military 
units to protect the companies in Hadramawt. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid said he will not allow criminal hands to 
harm foreigners who work in the country with the companies 
exploring for Yemeni oil.
