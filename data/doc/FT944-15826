FT  17 OCT 94 / Safety inspectors probe train collision in Kent
The Railway Inspectorate yesterday launched an investigation into a head-on
collision in Kent on Saturday which killed five and injured 11.
Several theories have been advanced to explain how the crash occurred on a
single-track stretch converted from double-track five years ago.
People living near the line, which runs from Oxted to Uckfield via a number
of village stations, complained at the time that a crash was 'inevitable'.
Concern centred on how two trains came to be travelling in opposite
directions on the same section - when they should have passed each other on
a double-track loop - on the quality of rolling stock, and on safety
systems.
It is possible that heavy fog in the area just before 9.00am, when the crash
occurred, was a factor.
Yesterday two inspectors at the scene were concentrating on checking the
signals and supervising the removal of the wreckage. One body remained
trapped.
Mr Chris Jago, a director of Railtrack, the state-owned track and signal
company, said there was nothing 'inherently wrong' with the single-track
system on the line, and that signalling had been replaced with modern
equipment about six years ago.
A red light should have stopped any train from entering a single-track
section of line already occupied by another, he said.
The rolling stock involved in the crash was more than 30 years old. There
was speculation that more modern carriages would have withstood the impact
better.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, promised that any lessons of
the inquiry would be acted on.
