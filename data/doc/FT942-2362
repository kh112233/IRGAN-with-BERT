FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Breathless
A breakdown in the air-conditioning system of a high-speed train left
passengers ill and gasping for air late last week. One traveller broke a
window on the train, from Paris to the southern city of Tarbes, as heat and
bad air became intolerable, French railway officials reported.
An unspecified number of passengers among the 600-700 making the trip were
taken ill and required medical treatment when the train was forced to make
an unscheduled stop for two hours.
