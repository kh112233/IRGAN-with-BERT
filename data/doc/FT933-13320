FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: World Bank let off too lightly
Sir, In your otherwise well-balanced editorial, 'Improving the World Bank'
(July 15), there is one important matter on which you let the World Bank off
too lightly.
You write: 'Many failures are to be explained by adverse global
developments, such as deteriorating terms of trade.' This statement treats
the deteriorating terms of trade as entirely an external factor, nothing to
do with the World Bank.
However, some of us think, and believe we can prove, that the deteriorating
terms of trade have a great deal to do with the type of structural
adjustment programmes impressed by the World Bank (as well as the
International Monetary Fund) upon developing countries.
The pressure towards 'outward orientation' simultaneously exerted upon so
many developing countries exporting the same commodity has the predictable
outcome of deteriorating terms of trade. This will also affect countries not
directly subject to structural adjustment programmes but competing with
countries which are.
The remedy must be for the World Bank (and IMF) to pay greater attention to
aggregation problems and abandon their strict and blinkered
country-by-country approach. It also follows that the world community must
pay more attention to macro-economic management, including stabilisation of
commodity prices.
