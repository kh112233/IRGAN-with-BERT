FT  07 MAY 94 / Regulator turns up heat in gas row
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, will next week carry out its threat to
publish a controversial consultation document on competition in the industry
if the government continues to delay its publication, Robert Corzine writes.
Ofgas yesterday said it saw no reason to delay publication further. Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, could reach a point next week where
she would release the report 'regardless of the politicians'.
The document, which sets out in detail how the domestic gas market will be
open to competition beginning in 1996, is awaiting approval by Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
The proposals have proved politically sensitive because of fears that
de-regulation would lead to wide price variations, with possible increases
for consumers who use relatively small amounts of gas.
Last month Ms Spottiswoode, who helped to write the report, threatened to
publish it unilaterally if the government failed to do so by yesterday.
Earlier this week Ofgas and the government agreed on a compromise date of
May 9. But yesterday it appeared that the government would miss the Monday
deadline.
