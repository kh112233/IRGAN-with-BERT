FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis wins Olympics deal with airlines
Chrysalis, the music publishing, communications and media group, has won its
first in-flight entertainment contract - providing highlights of the
Barcelona Olympics to airlines.
Fifteen leading airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Singapore
and Qantas, are taking a daily 15-minute highlights package delivered by
satellite.
Chrysalis, which has been attempting to build up its television interests,
bought the in-flight rights outside the US from the International Olympic
Committee.
Coverage is provided by TVE, the host broadcaster, by 1am and is then edited
and scripted by 5am.
The completed package is distributed to airline offices by the Eutelsat
organisation, in most cases in time to be carried on early morning flights.
Airlines pay a flat Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,150) for the coverage but most
of the revenue comes from advertising and sponsorship by Olympic sponsors
such as Coca Cola or Panasonic.
Mr Niall McBain, head of special projects at Chrysalis Television, hoped
that the deal would lead to in-flight coverage of other events.
Chrysalis is also hoping to enter the larger market of operating and
packaging programmes for the new six-channel choice television systems being
installed by airlines.
The company, which is developing plans for a games channel on cable
television, also has bought the UK home video rights for the Barcelona
Olympics.
