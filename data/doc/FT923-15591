FT  01 JUL 92 / Civil servants' pay pointer
UP TO 20,000 senior civil servants, including assistant secretaries and
principals, are almost certain to receive salary rises of between 4 per cent
and 6.2 per cent.
This follows a government survey of pay settlements in the private sector.
Under a pay formula the government is committed to giving rises to this
group of staff that fall within the middle 50 per cent of private-sector
settlements in the past year.
A report by the Office of Manpower Economics gives the range for the past
year as 4 per cent to 6.2 per cent, with a median of 5 per cent.
