FT  11 APR 94 / Further fixed-rate mortgage rise likely
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, is this week likely to
raise the rate it offers to borrowers for fixed-rate mortgages.
Other leading societies are also keeping their rate under close and constant
review. 'Twenty-four hours is now a long time for a fixed-rate mortgage
offer,' said one.
Last week Halifax building society, the UK's largest, increased its
fixed-rate mortgage offers by up to 0.75 of a percentage point.
While societies' variable rate mortgages are funded through retail savings,
fixed-rate mortgages are funded from the wholesale money market.
Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, said he believed
that the significant adjustment in fixed-rate offers had now taken place and
that there would not be much further change.
About half of societies' new lending is estimated to be through fixed-rate
mortgages.
Their continued popularity has led some societies to renew their questioning
of the approach to lending adopted by the Building Societies Commission, the
sector's statutory regulator.
Last year it issued a draft guidance note proposing a limit on fixed-rate
lending of 20 per cent of a society's commercial assets. That draft is still
under discussion. There are no similar constraints on banks' fixed-rate
lending.
