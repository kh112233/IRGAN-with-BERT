FT  31 DEC 94 / Blair prepares for fight on devolution and Lords' reform: PM
attacks opposition's 'dangerous' policy
Mr Tony Blair will today signal the start of a constitutional battle with
the Tories by setting out proposals for devolution - condemned yesterday by
Mr John Major as 'one of the most dangerous propositions ever put before the
British nation'.
The Labour leader plans to use a long-planned interview on BBC radio to
mount a strong defence of his plans to set up a Scottish parliament and a
Welsh assembly, reform the House of Lords and trim the monarchy.
Officials said he would reject Mr Major's demand, in a BBC radio interview
yesterday, for referendums on plans to establish the Scottish and Welsh
assemblies in the first year of a Labour government.
Mr Blair will argue that referendums are unnecessary because the legislation
will have been preceded by a general election in which the voters will be
offered a clear choice between the main parties' manifestos.
Labour officials dismissed the prime minister's attack on their +++++++ End
of Leg 1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ plans for Scotland and Wales as a
sign of his 'desperate' need to divert attention from the government's
problems over Europe.
However, leaders of both parties believe domestic constitutional issues will
be at the forefront of the next election campaign, alongside the UK's
relationship with the European Union. Mr Major, who sees his decision to
campaign for the integrity of the UK as a crucial factor in the
Conservatives' 1992 election victory, used his interview to attack Labour's
motives.
Claiming Labour leaders had failed to think through devolution, the prime
minister warned of a constitutional impasse if a Scottish National party
majority in the Scottish parliament sought to secede from the UK.
'It is done for short-term political advantage to the Labour party because
they are seeking to cash in on the innate pride in being Scottish that the
Scots feel, and they have given no thought whatsoever to the future unity of
the UK,' he said. The prime minister's playing of the constitutional card
prompted a derisive response from Mr George Foulkes, a Scottish Labour
frontbencher, who said Mr Major had 'gone completely off his rocker'.
Mr Menzies Campbell, a Scottish Liberal Democrat, said home rule would
strengthen the UK, and warned that 'blind refusal to acknowledge the need
for constitutional reform' played into the hands of the separatists.
Mr Major, in an attempt to douse the flames of Tory battles over Europe,
forecast an end to Conservative divisions on the issue.
The depth of hostility between the party's opposing factions was made clear,
however, by Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, who urged Tory
pro-Europeans to unite to prevent a Eurosceptic takeover.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary emphasised his Eurosceptic
views in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph. He suggested the European
Court of Justice should be reined back.
