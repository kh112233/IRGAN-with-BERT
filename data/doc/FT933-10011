FT  06 AUG 93 / Technology: Taking the sting out of tea on the lawn - Worth
Watching
A high-tech version of the old 'jam jar and sugar' trap promises to bring a
wasp-free summer to gardeners and those who like to eat outdoors.
Distributed by Catchensure, of London, and sold through garden centres, the
Waspy is a cone-shaped clear plastic container comprising a tray and a lid.
The tray is filled with a sweet liquid or jam; the lid raised slightly; and
the wasps follow their noses and climb through the small gap into the cone.
But as they try to escape, by flying towards the light, they hit the rigid
plastic sides of the trap. Catchensure: UK, 071 628 4200.
