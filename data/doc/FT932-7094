FT  26 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: QE2 findings disputed
The pilot, master and other officers of the QE2 were faulted by the US
National Transportation Safety Board for the ship's grounding off
Massachusetts last August which cost Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) in lost
revenue and Dollars 13.2m in repairs. Trafalgar House, parent of Cunard, the
ship's owner, disputed the findings.
