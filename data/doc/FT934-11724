FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Profits dive at Hitachi, NEC and
Toshiba - Electronics
For Japan's comprehensive electronics companies, the first six months of
fiscal 1993 were a race to cut costs and restructure their operations in a
desperate bid to beat both the adverse impact of a surge in the yen's value
and severe economic conditions at home.
The results announced yesterday for the period revealed that their efforts
have not yet filtered through enough to combat the severe deterioration in
their business environment.
Hitachi, NEC and Toshiba, which manufacture a wide range of products from
semiconductors to telecommunications equipment, all reported declines in
first-half pre-tax profits to the end of September. Mitsubishi Electric
reported a strong rise in pre-tax profits but a 66 per cent reduction in
operating profits.
Fujitsu, meanwhile, reported a larger loss and said that its full-year
results would be worse than previously forecast.
During the period concerned, all five companies came under heavy pressure as
the Japanese economy remained severely depressed and kept a lid on both
private sector demand and personal consumption.
Demand by private businesses for computers, information processing systems
and office automation products remained particularly weak. Fujitsu, for
example, saw a 21 per cent decline in sales of its computers and information
processing division. The sluggishness of demand for these products led to a
deterioration in prices particularly for computers and office automation
equipment.
For those companies with consumer electronics businesses, a continuing lack
of interest in audio-visual products among consumers as well as a sharp drop
in air conditioner sales due to an unusually cool summer, had a severe
impact on profits. Air conditioner sales in Japan this year are down more
than 1m units compared with last year.
Mitsubishi reported a 14 per cent decline in sales in its consumer products
division while Toshiba saw its sales in consumer electronics slump 12 per
cent. The depressed consumer electronics market in turn affected demand for
devices made by many of the large electronics companies, which were, as a
result, subject to intense price cutting.
Meanwhile, in overseas markets, the near 20 per cent rise in the yen's value
against the dollar was a harsh blow to their cost competitiveness and
profitability which could not be entirely offset by short-term measures,
such as foreign exchange hedging.
Toshiba, for one, noted that the yen's rise was a major factor in its 70 per
cent drop in operating profits to Y5.6bn (Dollars 52.8m) from a previous
Y19.1bn. But the company was able to offset the drop with a foreign exchange
gain of Y20bn through forward contracts.
The performance of the comprehensive electronics companies would have been
significantly worse, however, had it not been for their ability to offset
declines in some of their core businesses with increases in other business
areas on the back of strong public sector demand and a buoyant market for
semiconductors in the US.
Strong orders from utilities, for example, supported a 22 per cent rise in
the heavy electricals business at Toshiba. At the same time, demand for
products such as semiconductor memory chips rose strongly on demand from US
computer makers.
Nevertheless, the general outlook for the industry remains bleak. Most
companies do not expect the Japanese economy to recover significantly in the
second half of the fiscal year. Their main hope in lifting profits thus lies
in their cost-cutting efforts, which are being carried out across the
industry in varying degrees.
Fujitsu, for example, is hoping to reduce its workforce by 6,000 over the
next two years through natural attrition. The company is recruiting just 300
employees next spring compared with a peak of 3,870 in 1991. Fujitsu is also
reducing capital expenditure by about Y100bn and R&amp;D costs by about Y10bn.
Hitachi is reducing its workforce by 2,000 by the end of March through
transfers and natural attrition, in addition to a reduction of 2,500 in the
past year.
In contrast, Toshiba is taking a more moderate approach to cost-cutting.
While Toshiba aims to reduce its workforce by 5,000 over five years, it is
still recruiting 1,800 people next year compared with a peak of 3,000
earlier in the decade. Neither is the company planning to reduce capital
expenditure or R&amp;D costs this year.
Another way in which Japanese electronics companies are trying to reduce
costs is by buying more components and even complete products from overseas.
Fujitsu, for example, is planning to double procurement of foreign parts by
1995. NEC, for its part, will for the first time develop and manufacture
some of its PCs for the Japanese market in Hong Kong. NEC also plans to
increase the proportion of foreign-made components in its mainline PCs made
for the domestic market from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.
In the longer run, however, efforts to reduce costs will also have to be
supported further by development of higher value-added products.
Even amid the general downturn, Toshiba, for example, saw strong demand for
its colour liquid crystal display notebook PCs in the US, which increased
its PC sales in the US by 30 per cent.
