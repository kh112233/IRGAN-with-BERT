FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: JVC passes dividend as losses
continue
THE slowdown in the domestic market and the strength of the yen this year
dealt a blow to JVC, the maker of video cassette recorders and other
audio-visual products.
The Japanese company announced a pre-tax loss of Y9.9bn (Dollars 93.3m) on
sales 1 per cent lower at Y251.4bn and passed its interim dividend.
JVC is dependent on its audio-visual products, including blank cassette and
video tapes, for 79 per cent of its sales. Nearly half of the sales come
from overseas markets where the yen's strength reduces price
competitiveness.
This dependence has been costly for JVC, which rose to prominence as the
company that first commercialised the video cassette format used by most
consumers.
Video cassette sales in Japan have been on the decline, with shipments down
by 9 per cent this year according to industry estimates. Meanwhile, price
competition has become fierce.
The only bright spot has been in the US market where recent figures indicate
there has been a pick-up in demand for video products. JVC's entertainment
division increased sales by 27 per cent.
In order to cope with the difficult trading climate, JVC has set up a
special 'defensive' committee to oversee cost-cutting measures as well as an
'offensive' committee to strengthen product line-up and sales efforts.
JVC aims to reduce costs by Y20bn and restructure its operations. It is
transferring 400 employees from various departments to sales.
JVC expects losses to accumulate in the second half as economic conditions
in Japan remain sluggish.
