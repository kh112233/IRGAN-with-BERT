FT  03 MAR 94 / Technology: Testing time for AZT
Does Wellcome's Aids treatment, AZT, actually work?
Sometimes, and maybe quite often, is the accepted answer in the scientific
community. But that 'maybe' has been there for several years, mystifying
academics, drug regulatory authorities and carriers of HIV, the Aids virus,
alike. The latest research, far from clarifying matters, has only served to
confuse.
AZT's usefulness for people with symptoms of the disease is well documented
and the drug is widely prescribed. But AZT's sales growth has all but
stopped at less than Pounds 250m a year, partly because the number of Aids
sufferers is relatively small: estimates suggest that less than 10 per cent
of HIV carriers have the disease.
The question that remains is whether AZT can prevent the onset of Aids in
HIV carriers who are otherwise healthy.
That question was apparently answered almost a year ago when preliminary
results from the respected, long-term Anglo-French 'Concorde Trial'
suggested that HIV carriers did not benefit from receiving AZT. These
results contributed to Wellcome shares being the worst performing component
of the FT-SE 100 index in 1993.
But, while the final version of Concorde was being prepared, other
researchers continued testing AZT on HIV carriers.
The latest findings, published last week, appear to conflict with Concorde.
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore,
Maryland, who studied more than 2,000 HIV-infected men, say AZT 'delayed
Aids onset or extended life'. Alfred Saah, associate professor of
epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, said explicitly that the work disagreed with
Concorde.
Resolution of the confusion may now be close. Publication of the final
version of Concorde has been expected for several weeks. City analysts rank
it alongside profits figures in importance for Wellcome.
