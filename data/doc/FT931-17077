FT  02 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe underperforms as currency crises
bite - A look at 1992, and prospects for 1993
As a foretaste of what to expect this year, the events of 1992 were totally
unhelpful. Twelve months ago, I argued that currency stability and economic
convergence within Europe necessitated a radical re-think of portfolio
management. I argued that, in order to achieve efficient diversification,
investors based in Europe needed to decrease, rather than increase, their
exposure to EC stock markets.
The theory still holds. The problem, however, is that there is now an even
bigger question mark over the extent to which currency stability and
economic convergence can be achieved within the EC. The events of 1992 will
have served to rule these out as automatic, long-term assumptions in the
minds of investors.
Ironically, it is currency instability, both within and without Europe,
which will have sorted out the winners from the losers last year.
The French market, for example, gave only a modest return (6 per cent). UK
investors in that market never-theless enjoyed a 24 per cent sterling
return, thanks to the relative strength of the franc.
The reverse holds, of course. French investors in the UK market earned less
than 3 per cent, in contrast to the 20 per cent earned by UK investors in
their own market.
It was the strength of the US dollar against most major currencies which
really transformed international equity returns in 1992. And, while the
assumptions underlying my diversification theory may have collapsed,
European investors who did increase their stake in Wall Street would have
benefited substantially. The return on the US market itself (9 per cent) may
have been modest, but the dollar return earned overall would have far
surpassed this.
All this is already history. A fresh start can be made on Monday morning,
although decision-making is going to be no easier in 1993, especially taking
into account the strains and stresses within the European Community.
Nor is the general economic outlook for Europe any reason for optimism. The
fall in sterling and interest rates should fuel some modest growth in the UK
this year; elsewhere, however, the news becomes gloomier by the month,
particularly in Germany.
Further abroad, anyone reading Emiko Terazono's recent article (Financial
Times, December 29) can only have been drawn to the conclusion that another
painful and volatile year also lies ahead in Japan.
The Tokyo stock market may have found a bottom, thanks to government
support, but it would be only realistic to assume that pent-up selling
pressure will continue to delay the very long haul back to peak 1989 levels.
Cheerier news is emerging from the US, where the economy appears to be
gaining momentum at last. But, even there, considerable uncertainties
prevail, not least as to how the incoming administration intends to sustain
recovery, while being seen to tackle structural deficit and debt problems.
The bottom line is that we are still in an economic mess. And the
cleaning-up process will be far from easy. There is also a considerable
danger that quick fixes will be found instead of long-term solu-tions, given
political pressures worldwide.
The only safe prediction to make for 1993, it seems, is that the volatility
of currency and equity markets will remain exceptionally high.
It also seems that UK-based investors will have more to cope with than many
of their international counterparts. While I am sure Mr Lamont will have
consulted his Wise Men over the festive period, it is difficult to believe
that the U-turns and bumblings which were such features of 1992 will
suddenly stop.
This view may be far too parochial, now that we have all become European
citizens. On the other hand, that may not happen effectively until the UK
has ratified the Treaty.
