FT  02 NOV 93 / Female corporal awarded Pounds 17,000
A WOMAN sacked by the Army after becoming pregnant, but now serving again as
a corporal thanks to a rule change, will receive Pounds 17,000 for the
16-month gap in her career, it was agreed today.
Corporal Kim Castledine, had told a Newcastle upon Tyne industrial tribunal
that she was unfairly dismissed, and claimed sexual discrimination. But
after discussions behind closed doors, the Ministry of Defence accepted
liability and she withdrew her application.
After the hearing, Corporal Castledine, from North Shields, Tyne and Wear,
said she would receive Pounds 17,000 through the agreement.
Her case was the first of 19 involving women claiming unfair dismissal
against the MoD after losing service jobs through pregnancy that are due to
be heard in north-east England tribunals over the next fortnight.
Corporal Castledine, now earning Pounds 12,000-a-year, said: 'I felt bitter
when, due to an unplanned pregnancy, I was told I couldn't stay on in August
1989, but I am pleased with the way things have turned out and I have no
hard feelings.'
The case follows last month's Pounds 33,000 award to Ms Deborah Miller, a
former RAF woman dismissed after becoming pregnant. The previous month, in
an out-of-court settlement, Ms Jackie Thornber, a former RAF medical
assistant, received Pounds 22,000 after her dismissal.
