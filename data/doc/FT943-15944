FT  07 JUL 94 / Paraguay seeks Dollars 4bn for dam
The Paraguayan government is seeking private participation in the country's
third giant hydro-electric project, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said
yesterday.
The 4,000MW Corpus Cristi dam would lie between two huge existing
hydro-electric dams, Yacyreta and Itaipu. According to initial engineering
projections, the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Corpus dam would be more
efficient than either and yield an internal rate of return on investment of
27 per cent.
If built, it would be by far the largest electrical project in the world
financed by the private sector. Mr Wasmosy has agreed with President Carlos
Menem of Argentina to privatise the Yacyreta dam, on the
Argentine-Paraguayan frontier.
Speaking in London, Mr Wasmosy said the government also intended to move
ahead with its privatisation plans. It wants, through joint ventures or
privatisation, to divest itself of five enterprises: the steel and cement
plants, the merchant fleet, an alcohol and spirits plant, the railway system
and the national airline.
According to ministers travelling with the president, bidding for the
money-losing airline, which has ceased operations, will open on July 8.
A draft law now before Congress would give workers and suppliers 10 per cent
each of the privatised companies at concessional terms. Telephone, water,
electricity utilities and some other companies would remain in government
hands.
Mr Wasmosy said a summit of heads of state of Mercosur, the trade group
which includes Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, will take place on August 5 to
finalise details of a common external tariff. He was confident this would
take effect at the beginning of next year.
Yesterday he met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, signing accords on investment protection and on
co-operation against drug trafficking.
