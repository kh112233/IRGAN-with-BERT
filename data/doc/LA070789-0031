14,000 CIGARETTES GO UP IN SMOKE 
About 14,000 cigarettes went up in huge puffs of smoke outside a suburban 
Oklahoma City drugstore, and the owner said he will never sell tobacco again. 
Pharmacist Kenneth Henderson dumped about 700 packs of cigarettes, worth about 
$1,000, into a trash can Wednesday and tossed in a lighted match to burn them. 
Henderson said he decided to quit selling cigarettes as his part of a 
"NonDependence Day" observance by the American Lung Assn. 
"It just doesn't make sense for us to sell prescription items in the back to 
make people well, and sell cigarettes at another location to make them sick," 
Henderson said.
