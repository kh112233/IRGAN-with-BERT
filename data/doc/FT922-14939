FT  03 APR 92 / Kohl stands firm on Turkey row
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany refused to back down yesterday in his
confrontation with Turkey, insisting that German weapons supplied to its
Nato ally can only be used for its defence 'in the framework of the
alliance'.
Although he stopped short of direct criticism of Turkey's campaign against
Kurdish guerrillas and civilians, which caused Germany to suspend all arms
shipments last week, he said that Ankara must observe all its commitments to
human and minority rights.
In a parliamentary debate on the row between the two normally close allies,
Mr Kohl sought to turn the debacle to belated electoral advantage. With an
eye on the state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein on
Sunday, the chancellor delivered a ringing defence of his government's
foreign policy.
But Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, taunted Mr Kohl for
allowing the row to get out of hand. He said that Mr Dick Cheney, the US
defence secretary, had been forced to intervene between the Nato partners.
'We have reached a sorry state when our big brother in the alliance, the US,
must help us to return to the path of foreign policy virtue,' he said.
The number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany reached a
record of more than 35,000 last month, with refugees from Yugoslavia alone
running at 13,175. Romania was the second largest source, with 5,544 and
Turkey third with 2,406.
Turkey is to introduce economic reforms for the impoverished Kurdish
minority after unrest in the area in which more than 100 have died in the
past 10 days, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara.
The measures represent the first concrete steps to address the Kurdish
problem and stem growing support for the Syrian backed Kurdish Workers Party
which is fighting an eight year campaign for independence.
