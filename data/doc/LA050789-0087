THE WORLD 
Eight nations of South America's Amazon basin called on wealthy countries to 
provide money for the preservation of the world's greatest rain forest and for 
the economic development of the region. At the first summit meeting on the 
Amazon, the governments said the funds should be provided without any strings 
attached. The presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname 
and Venezuela and the foreign minister of Bolivia met in Manaus, Brazil, and 
issued a "Declaration of Amazonia." The document, taking note of the world 
outcry over the onslaught on the forests, said the international attention paid 
to the Amazon should be converted into "measures of cooperation on the 
financial and technical levels".
