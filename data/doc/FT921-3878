FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rentaminster Pounds 546,000 loss
Rentaminster, the USM-quoted company which supplies labour to the
construction and shop-fitting industries, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
546,000 in the six months to December 31 compared with a profit of Pounds
13,000 in the same period last year.
Turnover rose from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 3.34m, mainly because of two
acquisitions made during the period and a joint venture shop with Birleys
Sandwiches in London, which gained sales but was unable to achieve
profitability. It is to be sold at an extraordinary cost of Pounds 225,000.
Losses per share of 4.2p compared with earnings of 0.1p last time. Once
again there was no dividend.
