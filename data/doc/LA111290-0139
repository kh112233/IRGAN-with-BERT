LIZ SMITH: OPERA SINGER, ACTRESS BRINGS HER TALENTS TO THE 'KRAYS' 
THAT IS the opera singer/actress Julia Migenes, portraying Judy Garland in the 
new movie about the terrible twin Kray brothers of London, "The Krays." I guess 
somebody made Julia an offer she couldn't refuse. . . . Insiders are watching 
with wonder since Giancarlo Parretti sprang for $1.3 billion to buy MGM/UA. 
They wonder if financier Mario Gabelli has something similar in mind. He just 
bought 7,180,000 shares of Paramount. . . . Time Inc. is going to break my 
heart if it folds Entertainment Weekly. But it looks like they will. When you 
add this to their phase-out of that cable TV magazine several years back, it 
means Time will be marching on to the tune of a $100-million loss on these two 
projects alone. . . . British interests are claiming to have found huge 
potential oil areas around the Falkland Islands and in Argentina; maybe an even 
bigger find than the fields of the North Sea! . . . Baghdad's Saddam Hussein, a 
culture vulture? He has been begging opera's Placido Domingo to pay him a 
visit, but the great Spanish singer has declined. 
ANTHONY FRANCIOSA was one of Hollywood's big leading men in the '50s and '60s 
and a major theater actor. Now he is in rehearsal to make his musical debut and 
perform in his first-ever singing role in the international tour of Tommy 
Tune's "Grand Hotel, The Musical." (It won five Tony Awards in 1990.) The show 
bows in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 27. 
Remember, also, that Tony was the first husband of Shelley ("I Never Met an 
Italian I Didn't Like") Winters.
