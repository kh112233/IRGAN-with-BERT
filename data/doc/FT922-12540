FT  16 APR 92 / Observer: Passing the bok
Is it a flower, an animal, or an apartheid symbol? South Africans still
can't make up their mind whether their national sporting emblem should be a
springbok, a zebra or something beautiful, natural and neutral, like a
flower.
As the Olympic Games approach, the debate over the future of the springbok -
South Africa's traditional sporting symbol - is intensifying. In terms of
emotion, it ranks on a par with the question of what flag, if any, South
Africa should hoist at the Barcelona games.
The ANC-aligned National and Olympic Sports Congress (NOSC) has ruled that
the springbok is an apartheid symbol, and therefore causes considerable bad
feeling among blacks. It wants it replaced by the protea (the national
flower) and has produced six good reasons why. For example, a flower removes
the notion that sport is predominantly a male domain, and it is 'relevant to
the green issues'.
Not long ago the zebra looked like overtaking the springbok. Indeed, it was
the nickname given to South Africa's cricket team in the recent world cup.
One serious politician said that the black and white stripes on its skin
were appropriate given the country's racially diverse population.
Nevertheless, the ostrich also has its supporters on account of the
head-in-the-sand political and economic views of many in the population.
But does the NOSC have the authority to kill off the springbok? Sam Ramsamy,
head of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa, insists the decision
would be taken by his organisation; NOSC is but one affiliate. An added
complication is that springbok sports, like cricket and rugby, are not
Olympic sports. Hence their organisers could dispute the jurisdiction of
these bodies.
