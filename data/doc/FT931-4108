FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: Guarding against radio waves - Worth Watching
A gadget designed to allay the health fears surrounding the use of cellular
phones has hit the US market, writes Karen Zagor.
Cell Gard, a curved piece of aluminium the shape of a mini ski, deflects the
waves away from the head. The guard fits on the top of the phone and curves
towards the antenna.
According to JR Hunt Ventures, of Cocoa, Florida, the device blocks nearly
100 per cent of the phone's signal from the user's head.
It is designed to fit about 75 per cent of US cellular telephones. JR Hunt
